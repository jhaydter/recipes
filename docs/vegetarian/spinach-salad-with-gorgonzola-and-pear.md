## :pencil: Instructions

!!! note

    To make a smooth dressing, be sure the pear is completely ripe. Make sure to use baby, not curly, spinach here.

### Step 1

Cut 1 ripe Anjou pear half into large chunks and place in food processor. Add red wine vinegar, shallot, Dijon mustard,
brown sugar, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and process until smooth, about 15 seconds. With processor
running, slowly pour in canola oil and process until emulsified, about 30 seconds.

### Step 2

Thinly slice remaining pear half crosswise, toss with lemon juice, and set aside. Toss spinach and 1/2 cup dressing
together in large bowl. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Divide salad among individual plates and top each with
Gorgonzola, walnuts, pomegranate seeds, and sliced pear. Drizzle remaining 1/4 cup dressing over top. Serve.
