## :salt: Ingredients - Potatoes

- :potato: 1 lb yellow potatoes
- :salt: some salt
- :salt: some pepper
- :olive: 2 Tbsp olive oil
- :glass_of_milk: 4 Tbsp unsweetened plain almond milk or vegetable broth (for moisture)

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 large rimmed pan
- 1 large pot

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Heat a large rimmed pan over medium heat. Once hot, add olive oil or water and chopped shallot and sauté for 2 minutes,
stirring occasionally.

### Step 2

Add cremini mushrooms and 1 to 2 Tbsp coconut aminos and increase heat to medium-high. Sauté for 5 minutes, stirring
frequently. Add a pinch of salt and pepper.

### Step 3

Add thyme, dry green lentils, and 2 cups [vegetable broth][1] (480 ml // or the smaller end of the range if adjusting
recipe size). Bring to a low boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce heat to a simmer and cook on low for
about 20 minutes, adding more broth as needed if the mixture looks dry.

### Step 4

In the meantime, add yellow potatoes to a large pot and cover with water so they are just submerged. Bring to a boil on
high heat and cook for 12 to 15 minutes or until they slide off easily when pierced with a knife.

### Step 5

Once tender, drain potatoes and add back to pot or a mixing bowl. Season with salt, pepper, and a bit of olive oil and
mash until tender and fluffy. For added moisture in place of oil, add 2 to 4 Tbsp unsweetened plain almond milk or
vegetable broth (for moisture).

### Step 6

Once lentils are tender, taste sauce and adjust flavor as needed, adding more salt or coconut aminos for saltiness,
pepper for spice, or tomato paste for more depth of flavor (optional – we didn’t find it necessary). Turn off heat
and let the mixture rest so flavors can deepen. Add the 2 Tbsp (30 g // or more as needed) mashed potatoes to the lentil
mushroom stew and stir in to thicken.

### Step 7

To serve, divide mashed potatoes between serving plates or bowls and top with desired amount of lentil and mushroom
gravy. Garnish with fresh parsley (optional), [vegan Parmesan cheese][2] (optional), or more thyme, if desired.

### Step 8

Store leftovers separately, covered, up to 4 days in the refrigerator or in the freezer up to 1 month. Reheat on the
stovetop or in a 350°F (176°C) oven until hot.
