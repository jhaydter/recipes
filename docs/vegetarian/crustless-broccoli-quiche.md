### Step 1

Preheat your oven to 400Â°F. Generously butter a 9-inch glass or ceramic pie dish.

### Step 2

Place the frozen broccoli in a large microwave-safe bowl. Add 1/4 cup water. Cover and microwave on high for 6 minutes,
stirring after the first 3 minutes. Drain well.

### Step 3

In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, sour cream, salt, black pepper, and garlic powder. Stir in the broccoli, the
scallions, and the sharp cheddar cheese.

### Step 4

Transfer the mixture to the prepared pie dish. Bake the quiche until golden brown and a knife inserted in its center
comes out clean, about 30 minutes.

### Step 5

Allow the quiche to cool and set in the pan on a wire rack for about 15 minutes, then slice it into 8 triangles and
serve.
