## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Rinse lentils with cold water before boiling to remove any dust or debris. You can soak the lentils for one to two hours
to speed up the cooking process.

### Step 2

Wash the raisins and barberries and pat dry on kitchen paper.

### Step 3

Cook on a stovetop, using 3 cups of water to 1 cup of lentils. Be sure to use a large enough saucepan as the lentils
will double or triple in size. Bring to a boil, cover tightly, reduce heat and simmer until they are tender. For whole
lentils, cook time is typically 15-20 minutes. Then set aside.

### Step 4

In a large pan, heat the vegetable oil. Fry the onion until itâ€™s golden. Add the salt, cinnamon, turmeric, and bloomed
saffron. Reduce the heat and add the raisins and dates and stir. Set aside.

### Step 5

Pour 6 cups of water into a large nonstick pot and bring to a boil over high heat with salt. Add basmati rice into a pan
filled with boiling water. After 6 to 8 minutes when it begins to rise to the top and the water comes back to a boil.
Check the rice is cooked at the end by trying a grain. Break one grain in half. Rice should be soft on the outside but
hard in the middle. Pour rice into the colander to drain; then set aside.

### Step 6

Scoop one-third of the rice into the pot. Layer with one-third of the cooked lentils. Repeat until you're out of rice
and lentils and shape it into a pyramid. Add 3 tablespoons of the bloomed saffron. Cover the pot and cook until rice
begins to steam for 30 to 40 minutes.

### Step 7

Transfer the rice to a serving dish.
