## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 425°F. Set out a 9 inch deep-dish pie pan. Chop all the fresh produce.

### Step 2

Set a large sauté pan over medium heat. Add the unsalted butter. Once melted, add the onion and garlic. Sauté for 2 to
3 minutes.

### Step 3

Then add in the carrots, potatoes, and celery. Sauté another 5 minutes to soften and vegetables.

### Step 4

Stir in the all-purpose flour, fresh thyme, fresh rosemary, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon cracked black pepper. Make
sure the flour is evenly coating all the vegetables. Then stir in the vegetable broth.

### Step 5

Let the filling simmer for 3 to 5 minutes to thicken. Then turn off the heat and stir in the frozen peas, parsley, and
heavy cream. Set aside.

### Step 6

Meanwhile, roll out one round [pie crust][2] to 11 to 12 inches, or wide enough to fit down into the pie pan, while
still coming up the sides and over the edge.

### Step 7

Gently move the crust into the pie pan and crimp the edges firmly against the rim, so the crust doesn’t slump down in
the oven.

### Step 8

Prick the bottom of the crust with a fork multiple times, so that the crust doesn’t bubble. Then bake for 5 minutes on
the bottom rack.

### Step 9

Mix the eggwash using an egg and water. Once out of the oven, roll out the top crust, just wide enough to cover the top
of the pan, approximately 9 inches.

### Step 10

Scoop the vegetable filling into the pie pan. Brush the edges of the bottom crust with eggwash. Then gently move the top
crust over the filling. Use a fork to crimp the edges of the top crust to the bottom crust to seal.

### Step 11

Brush the top crust with eggwash. Then use a small knife to cut 3-4 vent holes in the top crust.

### Step 12

Bake on the bottom rack for 25 to 30 minutes. Check the pot pie after 15 minutes. If the crust starts looking dark,
place a piece of foil loosely over the top, then continue baking.

### Step 13

Once fully cooked and golden brown, remove the pie from the oven. Cool for 15 minutes before cutting to serve.
