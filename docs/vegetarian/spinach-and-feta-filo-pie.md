## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°C / 400°F / gas 6.

### Step 2

Toast the pine nuts in a large ovenproof frying pan over a medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes, or until golden and smelling
fantastic, tossing occasionally.

### Step 3

Crack the eggs into a large mixing bowl, crumble in the feta cheese, then grate in the Cheddar. Season with a pinch of
black pepper and a couple of pinches of dried oregano.

### Step 4

Finely grate in the lemon zest, drizzle in a little olive oil, then toss in the toasted pine nuts. Mix well.

### Step 5

Melt the unsalted butter in the frying pan over a medium heat with a drizzle of oil, add half the spinach, stirring
until wilted, then when there’s space, add the remaining spinach, stirring regularly until wilted.

### Step 6

Lay a 50 cm strip of greaseproof paper out on a clean work surface, rub lightly with oil and scrunch up, then flatten
out again.

### Step 7

Arrange 4 sheets of [filo][1] in a large rectangle on the greaseproof paper, overlapping at the edges, so that it’s
almost covering the greaseproof.

### Step 8

Rub the filo with a little oil, sprinkle with sea salt, pepper and a pinch of cayenne pepper. Repeat until you have 3
layers.

### Step 9

Stir the wilted spinach into the egg mixture, then grate in half the nutmeg and mix well.

### Step 10

Slide the greaseproof and filo into the empty frying pan, so that the edges spill over, then push down into the sides of
the pan.

### Step 11

Pour in the spinach mixture and spread out evenly, spread extra Cheddar on top of the mixture, then fold the filo up
over the filling to cover.

### Step 12

Sprinkle fresh rosemary over the top of the pie.

### Step 13

Place the pan over a medium heat for 2 minutes, just to get the bottom cooking, then transfer to the top shelf of the
oven for 18 to 20 minutes, or until golden and crisp. Delicious served with a fresh seasonal salad.
