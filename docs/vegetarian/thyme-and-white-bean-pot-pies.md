## :pencil: Instructions - Filling

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C) and arrange 6 ramekins on a baking sheet. Set aside.

### Step 2

Heat a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add olive oil and white or yellow onion. Season with a pinch each salt and
pepper and stir. Sauté until soft and translucent, about 4 to 5 minutes.

### Step 3

Add carrots and season with a pinch more salt and pepper. Cook 2 to 3 minutes, then add all-purpose flour and stir well
to thoroughly coat.

### Step 4

Cook for 1 minute, then slowly add dry white wine (optional) followed by vegetable broth, whisking to prevent clumps.

### Step 5

Add dry thyme and white beans and bring the mixture to a simmer. Then lower heat to low and simmer for a few minutes.
Cover and remove from heat while preparing crust.

## :pencil: Instructions - Crust

### Step 6

To prepare pie crust, add all-purpose flour and salt to a mixing bowl and whisk to combine.

### Step 7

Next add vegan butter or coconut oil and use a pastry cutter or fork to cut the two together, until it resembles wet
sand – about 30 to 45 seconds.

### Step 8

Add 4 to 7 Tbsp of ice cold water 1 Tbsp at a time and use a wooden spoon to gently mix. Add only as much water as
needed to help it come together and form a dough – about 4 to 6 Tbsp.

### Step 9

Use your hands to gently knead/form the dough in the bowl and gather any loose scraps. Then wrap in plastic wrap and
chill for 1/2 an hour.

### Step 10

Transfer directly to a well-floured surface and form into a disc with your hands.

### Step 11

Lightly flour the top of the dough, as well as a rolling pin, and gently roll out until about 1/8 inch thick. Add more
flour as needed to prevent sticking.

### Step 12

Use a pizza cutter or knife to cut into 6 large squares slightly larger than the size of your ramekins.

### Step 13

At this time, scoop the white bean filling into the ramekins until almost entirely full (reserve any leftovers to enjoy
as soup or future pot pies).

### Step 14

Use a lightly floured spatula to scoop each pie crust square onto a ramekin. Repeat until all ramekins are covered. Use
a knife or toothpick to create small holes in the top of the pie crust to allow steam to escape.

### Step 15

Bake pot pies for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the filling is bubbly and the pie crust is golden brown. Let cool 10
minutes before serving.

### Step 16

Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days, or in the freezer up to 1 month. Reheat in a 350°F
(176°C) oven until completely warmed through.
