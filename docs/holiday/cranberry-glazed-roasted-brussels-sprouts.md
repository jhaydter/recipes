## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 400°F.

### Step 2

Cut off the brown ends of the Brussels sprouts and pull off any yellow outer leaves. If the sprouts are large cut them
in half. Mix them in a bowl with the olive oil, salt, and pepper.

### Step 3

Pour them on a sheet pan and roast for 30 minutes, until crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. Shake the pan
from time to time to brown the sprouts evenly.

### Step 4

While the sprouts roast make the glaze. Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add shallots and sauté 6
minutes. Add Balsamic Vinegar. Increase heat to high and bring to a boil. Boil 5 to 8 minutes until balsamic vinegar is
reduced to a thick syrup. Stir in fresh cranberries, honey, and thyme.

### Step 5

Reduce heat and cook 6 minutes, until cranberries start to break down. Add the vegetable broth and bring to a boil.
Reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes, until thick. Add the mixture to a blender with the Dijon mustard and purée mixture
in a blender until smooth.

### Step 6

Pour the glaze over the roasted Brussels sprouts and return to the oven for anther 10 to 15 minutes or until glaze has
clung and coated the Brussels sprouts.
