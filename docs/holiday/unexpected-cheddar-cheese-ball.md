## :salt: Ingredients

- :cheese_wedge: 1 pkg Unexpected Cheddar
- :cheese_wedge: 1 pkg cream cheese
- :hot_pepper: 1 tsp chili pepper sauce
- :salt: 1 tsp 21 Seasoning Salute
- :lemon: 1 tsp lemon juice

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 cling wrap

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Add Unexpected Cheddar cheese broken up into chunks, cream cheese chili pepper sauce, 21 Seasoning Salute and lemon
juice to food processor bowl. Pulse to bring mixture together, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Continue to
process until mixture is smooth, 1 to 2 minutes.

### Step 2

Lay a square of cling wrap large enough to cover cheese ball on work surface. Scoop cheese mixture into center of wrap,
then gather wrap up on all sides, gently shaping the mixture into a ball. Twist the ends of the cling wrap tightly,
and refrigerate cheese ball (2 hours minimum, but overnight really lets the flavors meld together!).

### Step 3

Before serving, remove cheese ball from fridge. Spread chopped Sweet & Spicy pecans on work surface. Unwrap cheese ball
and press into chopped pecans, gently reshaping as needed. Serve with a cheese spreader, surrounded by TJ's Golden
Rounds Crackers.
