- :peanuts: 2 cups [creamy peanut butter][2]
- :glass_of_milk: 1 14-oz can [sweetened condensed milk][1]
- :icecream: 0.5 tsp vanilla

- 1 parchment paper

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Measure out all of your ingredients.

### Step 2

In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the white chocolate chips. Heat them in 15-second intervals, stirring in between each
heating cycle. Repeat until the white chocolate chips are melted and smooth.

### Step 3

In a separate microwave-safe bowl, melt the creamy peanut butter so it becomes liquid. Heat it in 15 to 30 second
intervals to avoid scorching.

### Step 4

In a larger mixing bowl, combine the melted white chocolate and [peanut butter][2], and mix until smooth.

### Step 5

Add in the [sweetened condensed milk][1], vanilla extract, and salt, then mix until thoroughly combined.

### Step 6

Evenly spread the mixture into a 10 X 10 inch pan. You can use a piece of parchment paper on top to smooth it out if
desired.

### Step 7

At this point you can either let it set, or go on to optionally garnish the fudge with extra melted peanut butter and
chopped white chocolate chips.

### Step 8

The peanut butter fudge will need to set for around 2 hours at room temperature.

### Step 9

Once set, slice into 24 pieces and enjoy!
