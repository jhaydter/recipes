In a liquid measuring cup, combine the vegetable stock, Shaoxing wine, oyster sauce, salt, sugar, sesame oil, and white
pepper.

### Step 2

In a wok over medium heat, add the vegetable oil and ginger. Cook until the ginger is lightly browned at the edges, and
then add the sliced mushrooms. Stir-fry for 1 to 2 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.

### Step 3
