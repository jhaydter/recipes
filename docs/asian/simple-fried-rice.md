### Step 1

Beat eggs and 1/4 teaspoon salt in bowl until well combined. Heat 2 teaspoons vegetable oil in 14-inch
flat-bottomed wok or 12-inch carbon-steel or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until oil is just smoking. Add eggs
and cook, stirring frequently, always until very little liquid egg remains, 30 to 60 seconds. Transfer to large plate.

### Step 2

Add 1 teaspoon oil to now-empty wok and reduce heat to medium. Add carrot and 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring
frequently, until just beginning to brown, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer to plate with eggs.

### Step 3

Add scallion whites and remaining 1 tablespoon oil to now-empty wok. Cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1
minute. Add cooked jasmine rice and stir until combined. (It's OK if some clumps of rice remain.) Spread into even
layer. Sprinkle pepper and remaining 1 teaspoon salt evenly over rice. Continue to

### Step 4

cook, stirring frequently and pressing on rice with spatula to break up clumps, until grains are separate and heated
through, 2 to 5 minutes longer. Add frozen peas, egg mixture, and scallion greens and cook, stirring frequently and
using edge of spatula to break eggs into small pieces, until peas are warmed through, about 2 minutes. Serve.
