## :salt: Ingredients

- :butter: 6 Tbsp butter
- :candy: 4 tsp granulated sugar
- :salt: 1 tsp salt
- :glass_of_milk: 10 oz cold milk
- :egg: 1 large egg
- :ear_of_rice: 7.5 oz all-purpose flour
- :microbe: 1.25 tsp instant yeast
- :cup_with_straw: 0.25 tsp baking soda

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 3 quart stainless steel saucier or saucepan
- 1 heat-resistant spatula
- 1 waffle iron

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Melt butter in a 3 quart stainless steel saucier or saucepan, stirring and scraping with a heat-resistant spatula as it
bubbles, and cook until golden brown. Remove from heat and immediately stir in granulated sugar, salt, and cold milk,
followed by egg. Sift in all-purpose flour and stir until smooth. Add instant yeast and baking soda last, stirring to
combine. Cover and refrigerate overnight, between 12 and 18 hours. The batter should be gooey and spongy at this point.

### Step 2

Set waffle iron to medium and preheat until the indicator is ready; if using cast iron, brush lightly with safflower,
vegetable, or canola oil. For an 8-inch square machine, scrape in half of the batter per batch. For a 7 inch Belgian
machine, scrape in about one-third. Close lid and griddle until golden brown but still steaming, 5 to 7 minutes
depending on the depth and heat of your machine. (Cooked waffles can be held on a rack in a 200°F (90°C) oven while
remaining batches are cooked.) Serve immediately with maple syrup, lemon chantilly, and/or strawberries.
