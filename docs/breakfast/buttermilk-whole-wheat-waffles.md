### Step 1

zest and then sprinkle with a little sugar to taste. Set aside to macerate while mixing up the waffle ingredients.

### Step 2

Preheat waffle iron.

### Step 3

In a medium bowl, whisk together the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, cornmeal, salt, and baking soda.

### Step 4

In another medium bowl, whisk the egg. Add the buttermilk and the cooled melted butter and whisk again. Gradually add to
the dry ingredients to form a batter and mix gently with a spoon until combined. Thin batter with a little 2% milk if
needed.

### Step 5

Lightly oil the waffle grill and spoon batter into the waffle iron. Cook until golden brown. Serve immediately with
butter, maple syrup and berries. Also, the waffles freeze well.
