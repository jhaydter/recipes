| :timer_clock: Total Time |
|:-----------------------: |
| 25 minutes |

## :salt: Ingredients

- :ear_of_rice: 280 g all-purpose flour
- :dash: 1 Tbsp baking powder
- :candy: 3 Tbsp granulated sugar
- :salt: 0.5 tsp salt
- :butter: 5 Tbsp unsalted butter
- :cherries: 80 g currants or dried cranberries
- :icecream: 1 cup heavy cream

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 large bowl or work bowl of food processor
- 1 knives
- 1 rubber spatula or fork
- 1 8 inch cake pan
- 1 baking sheet
- 1 wire rack

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425°F.

### Step 2

Place all-purpose flour, baking powder, granulated sugar and salt in large bowl or work bowl of food processor fitted
with steel blade. Whisk together or pulse six times.

### Step 3

If making by hand, use two knives, a pastry blender or your fingertips and quickly cut in unsalted butter until mixture
resembles coarse meal, with a few slightly larger butter lumps. Stir in currants or dried cranberries. If using food
processor, remove cover and distribute butter evenly over dry ingredients. Cover and pulse 12 times, each pulse lasting
1 second. Add currants and pulse one more time. Transfer dough to large bowl.

### Step 4

Stir in heavy cream with a rubber spatula or fork until dough begins to form, about 30 seconds.

### Step 5

Transfer dough and all dry, floury bits to countertop and knead dough by hand just until it comes together into a rough,
sticky ball, 5 to 10 seconds. Form scones by either a) pressing the dough into an 8 inch cake pan, then turning the
dough out onto a lightly floured work surface, cutting the dough into 8 wedges with either a knife or bench scraper (the
book’s suggestion) or b) patting the dough onto a lightly floured work surface into a 3/4 inch thick circle, cutting
pieces with a biscuit cutter, and pressing remaining scraps back into another piece (what I did) and cutting until dough
has been used up. (Be warned if you use this latter method, the scones that are made from the remaining scraps will be
much lumpier and less pretty, but taste fine. As in, I understand why they suggested the first method.)

### Step 6

Place rounds or wedges on ungreased baking sheet and bake until scone tops are light brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool on
wire rack for at least 10 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.
