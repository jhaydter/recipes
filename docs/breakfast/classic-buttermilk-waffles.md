## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

In a medium-sized mixing bowl, beat together the eggs, buttermilk, melted butter, and vanilla.

### Step 2

In a separate bowl whisk together the all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

### Step 3

Combine the wet and dry ingredients, stirring just until nearly smooth; a few small lumps may remain.

### Step 4

Spray your waffle iron with a non-stick cooking spray before preheating it. Cook waffles according to the manufacturer's
directions. For an 8" round waffle iron, use about 1/3 cup batter; cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until the iron stops
steaming.

### Step 5

Tip: Waffles are best consumed as soon as they're baked, but in a pinch you may place them on a rack to cool, wrap
tightly to store in the refrigerator, then reheat for 6 minutes in a 350°F oven.

### Step 6

Note: Leave out the sugar if you want savory waffles, such as the type you'd use as a base for creamed chipped beef or
fried chicken.
