## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Beat eggs in large bowl and add milk.

### Step 2

Tear flour tortillas into strips.

### Step 3

Spray sides and wall of slow cooker with Pam.

### Step 4

Put small amounts of salsa (2 thin, 1 chunky) in bottom of slow cooker, so casserole doesn't stick.

### Step 5

Heat large skillet with plenty of butter.

### Step 6

Add beaten eggs and milk mixture, only lightly scramble eggs. Turn off heat.

### Step 7

Simply layer tortillas, eggs, salsa, and blended shredded cheese into slow cooker.

### Step 8

You can also make this the night before - However, I find casserole turns out great if left on low for 2 to 4 hours.

### Step 9

Stir before serving.

### Step 10

Side with sour cream and guacamole.
