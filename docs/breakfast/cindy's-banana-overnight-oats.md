| :timer_clock: Total Time |
|:-----------------------: |
| 6.00 hours |

## :salt: Ingredients

- :glass_of_milk: 2 cups almond milk
- :banana: 3 bananas
- :ear_of_rice: 2.5 cup rolled oats
- :salt: some salt

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 immersion blender
- 1 mason jar

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

With an immersion blender, blend almond milk and bananas.

### Step 2

To a mason jar or small bowl with a lid, add the almond milk and banana mixture and  rolled oats and stir a few more
times. Then press down with a spoon to ensure all oats have been moistened and are immersed in almond milk.

### Step 3

Add salt to taste.

### Step 4

Cover securely with a lid or seal and set in the refrigerator overnight (or for at least 6 hours) to set/soak.

### Step 5

The next day, open and enjoy as is or garnish with desired toppings (see options above). See more flavor/topping
suggestions in the blog post above!

### Step 6

OPTIONAL: You can also heat your oats in the microwave for 45-60 seconds (just ensure there's enough room at the top of
your jar to allow for expansion and prevent overflow), or transfer oats to a saucepan and heat over medium heat until
warmed through. Add more liquid as needed if oats get too thick/dry.

### Step 7

Overnight oats will keep in the refrigerator for 2-3 days, though best within the first 12-24 hours in our experience.
Not freezer friendly.
