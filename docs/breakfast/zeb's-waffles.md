- :chestnut: 0.25 cup walnuts
- :ear_of_rice: 2 Tbsp flaxseed meal
- :custard: 0.25 tsp cinnamon
- :banana: 1 banana
- :glass_of_milk: 0.5 cup milk
- :kiwifruit: 2 kiwi
- :strawberry: 0.5 cup raspberries

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 waffle iron
- 1 grater or vegetable peeler
- 1 bowl
- 1 food processor or high-speed blender

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat a waffle iron. Using a grater or vegetable peeler, zest the orange.

### Step 2

In a bowl, combine the rolled oats, walnuts, flaxseed meal, orange zest, and cinnamon. Place two-thirds of the mixture
into a food processor or high-speed blender.

### Step 3

Blend until the mixture has a flour-like texture. Return to the bowl with the remaining one-third of the dry
ingredients; this step ensures that the waffles have a chunky texture. If you prefer a smoother, uniform texture to your
waffles, blend all of the dry ingredients initially.

### Step 4

Add the smashed banana and milk to the dry ingredients in the bowl. Mix thoroughly with a fork; the batter will be
fairly thick. If you prefer a thinner batter, add more milk.

### Step 5

Portion the batter thickly onto a preheated waffle iron and spread it out to all corners. Close the lid and cook the
waffle according to the manufacturerâ€™s directions for your waffle iron. When done, remove the waffle from the iron
(some waffles require the assistance of a chopstick to encourage release from the waffle iron). Top with sliced kiwi,
raspberries, and maple syrup.
