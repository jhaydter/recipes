- :potato: 1 lb Russet potatoes
- :ear_of_rice: 0.67 cups all-purpose flour
- :seedling: 1 tsp caraway seeds (optional)

- 1 12 inch nonstick skillet

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200°F. Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet. Place
[mashed potatoes][1] in medium bowl.

### Step 2

Peel Russet potatoes and grate on large holes of box grater. Place half of shredded potatoes in center of clean dish
towel. Gather ends together and twist tightly over sink to drain as much liquid as possible. Add shreds to bowl with
mashed potatoes. Repeat with remaining shredded potatoes.

### Step 3

Add all-purpose flour, caraway seeds (optional), if using, salt and pepper to potatoes and mix, breaking up any large
mashed potato lumps, until evenly combined. While stirring, add enough milk so mixture is moistened but thick and stiff
enough to scoop (you may not need all of milk).

### Step 4

Melt 2 tablespoons unsalted butter in 12 inch nonstick skillet over low heat. Spoon batter into 1/4 cup dry measuring
cup and deposit onto skillet. Deposit 3 more portions onto skillet. Using back of measuring cup, press each portion into
3.5 inch round. Increase heat to medium. Cover and cook until tops of pan cakes are set and bottoms are deeply browned
(color will not be uniform), 3 to 5 minutes, adjusting heat as necessary to prevent butter from burning.

### Step 5

Carefully uncover (condensation may cause splattering); flip pancakes; and continue to cook, uncovered, until browned on
second side, 3 to 4 minutes longer. Transfer pancakes to prepared sheet and place in oven. Wipe out skillet with paper
towels and repeat with remaining butter and potato mixture in 2 batches.

### Step 6

Season with salt to taste, and serve immediately. (Pancakes can be refrigerated in airtight container for up to 2 days
and reheated in dry skillet on stovetop or on rimmed baking sheet in 350°F oven.)
