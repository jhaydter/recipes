## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

In a large bowl, whisk together the water, sweet potato puree, and cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice. Add the pancake mix
and stir just to combineâ€”the batter should be lumpy.

### Step 2

Place a griddle or nonstick skillet over medium-high heat to let it get nice and hot. Then reduce the heat to medium.
Melt a little butter in the skillet then swirl to coat the bottom of the skillet.

### Step 3

For each pancake, spoon in 1/4 cup of batter. Cook until bubbles form on top of the pancakes and the batter is set, 2 to
3 minutes. Then use a spatula to flip the pancakes and cook them until golden brown on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes.
Serve with warm syrup.
