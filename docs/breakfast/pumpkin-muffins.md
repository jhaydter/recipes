## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 375°F and place 12 paper liners into each well of your standard size muffin baking pan.

### Step 2

Measure out the all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, dark brown sugar, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ground cloves, and
nutmeg in a medium bowl and whisk together. Set aside.

### Step 3

In another bowl, whisk together the eggs, [pumpkin purée][1], coconut oil, melted, and vanilla extract.

### Step 4

Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir together. Do not over mix, just stir until everything is
incorporated into the batter.

### Step 5

It is helpful to use a large scoop (like an ice cream scoop) to evenly distribute the batter into each well. They will
be nearly full. This will help give your muffins a nice puffy dome.

### Step 6

Bake your muffins for 20 to 22 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.

### Step 7

Note: Recipe adapted from Sally’s Baking Addiction If your coconut oil is solid, warm it up a bit so that it is in
liquid form.
