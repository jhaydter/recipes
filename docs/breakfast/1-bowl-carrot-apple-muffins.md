## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Prepare flax eggs in a large mixing bowl by mixing flaxseed meal and water and let rest for a few minutes. Preheat oven
to 375°F (190 C).

### Step 2

Prepare muffin tin with liners or lightly grease them.

### Step 3

To the flax eggs, add mashed banana, agave or maple syrup, olive oil and whisk to combine.

### Step 4

Next add unsweetened applesauce, brown sugar, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and whisk to combine.

### Step 5

Add almond milk and stir.

### Step 6

Add grated carrot and stir.

### Step 7

Add oats, almond meal, and gluten-free flour blend and stir.

### Step 8

Divide evenly among 12 muffin tins, filling them all the way up to the top, and top with crushed walnuts (optional).

### Step 9

Bake for 32 to 36 minutes, or until deep golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. When
you press on the top it shouldn’t feel too spongy, so don’t be afraid of over baking! The gluten-free blend just
takes longer to bake.

### Step 10

Remove from oven and let set in the pan for 15 minutes. Then flip on their sides still in the pan to let cool
completely.

### Step 11

If you try to unwrap them too quickly, they have a tendency to stick to the wrappers.

### Step 12

Once cooled, store in a covered container or bag at room temp to keep fresh. Freeze after that to keep fresh.
