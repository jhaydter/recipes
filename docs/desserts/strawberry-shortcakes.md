## :pencil: Instructions - Shortcake

### Step 1

Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 450°F. Line rimmed baking sheet with
parchment paper. In medium bowl, whisk together all-purpose flour, 3/4 teaspoon granulated sugar, baking powder, baking
soda, and salt. Microwave heavy cream until just warmed to body temperature (95 to 100°F), about 15 seconds. Stir warm
cream into flour mixture until soft, uniform dough forms.

### Step 2

Spray 1/3-cup dry measuring cup with vegetable oil spray. Using spoon, transfer half of dough to prepared measuring cup,
pressing to fill bottom of cup (cup will not be completely filled). Run butter knife around edge of cup and deposit
dough onto prepared sheet. Repeat with remaining dough. If portions are misshapen, use your fingers to gently reshape
dough into level cylinders. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar over shortcakes. Bake until tops are light
golden brown, 9 to 11 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Transfer to wire rack and let cool completely,
about 20 minutes. While shortcakes cool, prepare strawberries and cream.

### Step 3

In medium bowl, stir together 1/4" thick sliced strawberries, granulated sugar, and lemon juice. Using potato masher,
mash one-third of strawberries. Let rest, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved and strawberries are juicy,
about 20 minutes. Whisk chilled heavy cream in small bowl until small bubbles form, about 30 seconds. Add confectioners'
sugar and vanilla. Continue to whisk until soft peaks form, about 1/2 minutes longer. Do not overwhip.

### Step 4

Split shortcakes crosswise and place bottoms on plates. Place half of whipped cream on bottom of each shortcake. Top
each portion with half of strawberry mixture. Cap with shortcake tops and dust with extra confectioners' sugar, if
desired. Serve.
