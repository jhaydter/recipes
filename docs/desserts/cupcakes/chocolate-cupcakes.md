## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 350°F.

### Step 2

Sift together all-purpose flour, salt, baking soda, and cocoa powder into a separate medium-sized bowl. Use a fork or
whisk to ensure that the ingredients are mixed well after sifting. Set aside.

### Step 3

In a medium-sized mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer, mix unsalted butter and granulated sugar until fully
combined. The end result should look like wet sand.

### Step 4

Melt the semisweet chocolate in the microwave or in a double boiler.

### Step 5

Once the melted chocolate is cool enough to touch, add it to the butter/sugar mixture and mix until just combined.

### Step 6

Mix in eggs and egg yolks one at a time until just combined.

### Step 7

Mix in vegetable oil, vanilla, and full-fat sour cream until just combined.

### Step 8

Add dry ingredients to wet ingredients in three additions, mixing until just combined after each addition.

### Step 9

Mix in room temperature water until just combined.

### Step 10

Fill cupcake liners 2/3 full and put in the oven.

### Step 11

Check for doneness at 18 minutes – a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake should come out clean. If they
are not done, check again every three minutes until they are done.

### Step 12

Immediately remove cupcakes from the cupcake tin and place on a cooling rack or on the counter to cool to room
temperature. Although they are really good when they are hot, be sure to wait until they are room temperature to give
your evaluation.

### Step 13

Top with [chocolate ganache][1] frosting.
