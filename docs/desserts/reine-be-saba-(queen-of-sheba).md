- :coffee: 2 Tbsp strong, hot coffee
- :butter: 6 Tbsp unsalted butter, softened and cut into cubes
- :salt: 1 pinch salt

- 1 8 inch piece of parchment paper
- 1 small bowl
- 1 pan

## :pencil: Instructions - Cake

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 325°F. Set the rack to the lower middle level. Butter an 8 x 1.5 inch round cake pan, place an 8
inch piece of parchment paper in the bottom, brush with butter and coat the whole pan with flour.

### Step 2

In a small bowl, combine the bittersweet chocolate and the strong, hot coffee. Set aside for a few minutes for the
chocolate to melt. (If the chocolate doesn’t melt down completely, place the bowl in a few inches of hot water for a
minute or two.)

### Step 3

Meanwhile, beat the egg whites until foaming, add the salt, and continue beating until soft peaks form. Gradually beat
in the 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar and continue beating until shiny peaks form. Don’t make the whites too stiff
or they’ll be difficult to incorporate. Set aside while you go on to the next steps but don’t dawdle, as you want to
use the whites as soon as possible.

### Step 4

In another bowl, using the same beaters, cream the unsalted butter until soft, add the 1/2 cup sugar and beat until
fluffy. Then beat in the egg yolks.

### Step 5

Stir the warm chocolate into the yolk mixture, then add the pulverized almonds with 2 Tbsp granulated sugar and almond
extract. Gently stir a dollop of the egg whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it. Add the remaining whites and,
alternating with sprinkles of the flour, gently but quickly fold in the whites.

### Step 6

Turn the batter into the prepared pan and spread the batter evenly over the bottom. Place in the preheated oven and bake
for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the edges of the cake are set about 3 inches in but the center is still a little soft and
shiny.

### Step 7

Remove from the oven and place on a rack and cool for 10 minutes, then carefully run a knife around the edges and unmold
onto the rack, peeling off the parchment paper. The center may want to stick to the pan. If so, just use a knife to
scoop it back into the center of the cake. This little blotch will be covered with the frosting. Let it cool completely.

### Step 8

Place the bittersweet chocolate, chopped fine and the strong, hot coffee in a bowl, stir, and set aside in a warm place
for the chocolate to melt. You may have to place the bowl in a few inches hot water if the chocolate doesn’t melt
completely. Stir until smooth.

## :pencil: Instructions - Frosting

### Step 9

Whisk the unsalted butter, softened and cut into cubes, one cube at a time, into the chocolate along with the salt,
until all of the butter is incorporated. The mixture may be a bit runny. If so, set it on the counter until it thickens
to spreading consistency.

### Step 10

Frost the top and sides of the cake and decorate the top with a swirl if you’d like. Picking the cake up in your left
hand, press the slivered almonds into the side of the cake with your right hand, tilting the cake slightly so the excess
almonds fall off.

### Step 11

Serve with pride and joy!
