## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Mix the sugar, cornstarch, and salt together in a heavy-bottomed medium saucepan. Whisk in the whole milk and egg yolks.

### Step 2

Heat over medium, whisking constantly until the mixture thickens and bubbles, which takes about 5 to 8 minutes. Once
thickened, continue to cook for an additional 1 to 2 minutes all while still whisking constantly.

### Step 3

Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter and vanilla. Pour into a heat-proof container and press a layer of plastic
wrap to the top of the pudding, making sure the plastic wrap makes contact with all of it in order to prevent a film
forming as it cools.

### Step 4

Chill in the fridge for 4 hours, or overnight.

### Step 5

Before serving, stir the pudding well. Transfer to serving bowls (optional), if desired. Top with toppings of your
choice. I always like serving it with fresh berries (optional) and [vanilla wafers][1] (optional)!
