## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Rinse and remove the stems from the blueberries. Wipe them off as much as possible. Freeze the blueberries on a
parchment-lined baking sheet for 4 hours or overnight so they are completely frozen.

### Step 2

Once frozen, add the blueberries, honey, lemon juice (save the zest for later) and water to the bowl of a food
processor. Process the blueberries until they become crumbly, pressing down the mixture with a spatula as needed.
Continue to process until the blueberries becomes very smooth. You will have to mix a few times with the spatula to
ensure even processing. This process will take at least 8 minutes or so. Fold in the lemon zest.

### Step 3

Transfer the sorbet to an airtight container and freeze for another 30 minutes or longer. Enjoy!
