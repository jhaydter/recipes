### Step 2

To make the crust, process graham crackers in food processor until fine. Combine graham cracker crumbs, unsalted butter,
melted, granulated sugar, and salt in a medium bowl. Transfer mixture to the pan and pat into an even layer using the
bottom of a measuring cup or meat pounder. Freeze the dough in the pan, about 15 minutes. Place pan on a baking sheet.
Bake until the crust is firm to the touch and deeply golden brown, about 15 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack to cool
completely.

### Step 3

In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the (7 pkgs) cream cheese on medium speed until
fluffy, about 3 minutes, scraping down sides as needed.

### Step 4

In a large bowl, whisk together granulated sugar and all-purpose flour. With mixer on low speed, add vanilla. Gradually
add a little bit of the sugar mixture to cream cheese, a little bit of sour cream, room temperature and an eggs. Repeat
process until all ingredients are mixed. Beat until just combined; do not over mix.

### Step 5

Optionally, add a tsp of lemon zest (optional).

### Step 6

Pour cream cheese filling into the prepared pan. Set pan inside a large, shallow roasting pan. Carefully ladle boiling
water into roasting pan to reach halfway up sides of springform pan.

### Step 7

Bake 45 minutes; reduce oven temperature to 325°F. Continue baking until cake is set but still slightly wobbly in the
center, about 30 minutes more. Turn off oven; leave cake in oven with the door slightly ajar, about 1 hour. Transfer pan
to a wire rack; let cake cool completely. Refrigerate, uncovered, at least 6 hours or overnight. Before unmolding, run a
knife around the edge of the cake.

### Step 8

Optionally, add a [sour cream topping][1].
