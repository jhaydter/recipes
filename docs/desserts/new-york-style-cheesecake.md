## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Do not be afraid of the extreme oven temperature - the surface of the cake will be golden, with a creamy interior.
Preheat the oven to 400°F. Lightly grease a 9-inch spring-form pan. Prepare the dough for [shortbread crust][1].

### Step 2

Press one-third of the dough, or slightly less, over the bottom of the pan as evenly as possible. Prick the dough all
over with a fork. Bake until the crust is light golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Let cool completely on a rack. Press the
remaining dough about 1/8 inch thick around the sides of the pan, making sure that it is attached to the bottom crust
all around. Brush the bottom and sides of the crust with 1 well beaten  egg white.

### Step 3

Refrigerate the crust if you are not filling it right away. Have all of the ingredients at room temperature, about
70°F. Preheat the oven to 500°F.

### Step 4

Beat in a large bowl until smooth and creamy, about 30 seconds cream cheese.

### Step 5

Scrape the sides of the bowl and the beaters well. Gradually add and beat until smooth and creamy, 1 to 2 minutes sugar
and all-purpose flour (optional), if you prefer a denser texture.

### Step 6

Beat in lemon zest and vanilla.

### Step 7

Beat in one at a time just until incorporated, scraping the sides of the bowl and the beaters after each addition eggs
and egg yolks.

### Step 8

On low speed, beat in heavy cream.

### Step 9

Scrape the batter into the crust and smooth the top. Bake for 15 minutes at 500°F, then reduce the oven temperature to
200°F and bake for 1 hour more. Turn the oven off, prop the oven door ajar with the handle of a wooden spoon, and let
the cake cool in the oven for 30 minutes. Remove to a rack and let completely in the pan before unmolding. Cover and
refrigerate for at least 6 hours, preferably 24 hours, before serving. The cheese flavor is even more intense after 48
hours.
