## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.

### Step 2

In the bowl of a mixer, cream together 1 stick butter and 3/4 cup sugar, scraping down the sides occasionally. Add the
vanilla and egg, mix in.

### Step 3

In a separate bowl, mix together 2 cups flour, baking powder and salt. Add one half of it to the mixer, and when mostly
combined, add the milk. Once the milk is mostly incorporated, add the rest of the flour.

### Step 4

To make filling: in a small bowl, pinch together the softened 3 Tbsp butter, 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1
Tbsp cinnamon until soft crumbs form.

### Step 5

To make topping: add 5 Tbsp butter, 3/4 cup flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 Tbsp cinnamon to a food processor and pulse
until coarse crumbs form (You can cut in with forks or a pastry cutter, but I am not patient enough for that!).

### Step 6

Grease a 9x9 baking pan. Pour in 1/2 of cake batter, and spread to all four corners. Sprinkle the filling over top, then
pour in remaining cake batter, and spread carefully across the top, disturbing the filling layer as little as possible
(an offset spatula works well for this).

### Step 7

Sprinkle the topping over the top and press lightly so it adheres.

### Step 8

Bake in preheated oven for 45 to 50 minutes, until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Cool to warm on wire rack
before serving.
