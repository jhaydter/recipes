## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Prepare the cupcakes: Preheat oven to 350°F.

### Step 2

In a mixing bowl, add the egg, Canola oil, melted unsalted butter, and cane sugar and whisk until smooth. Add whole milk
and TJ's Hatch Valley Salsa and stir to combine.

### Step 3

Add the entire box of TJ's Cornbread Mix and stir until smooth.

### Step 4

Line a cupcake pan with cupcake liners and fill each cup about 3/4 of the way full with batter.

### Step 5

Bake for 17 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean. Let cool completely before
frosting.

### Step 6

Prepare the frosting: Using a stand mixer with a whisk attachment, combine softened unsalted butter and sea salt and
beat on medium-high for 6 to 7 minutes, until light & creamy.

### Step 7

Reduce speed to medium-low and add honey and powdered sugar, taking care to add powdered sugar about 1/2 cup at a time
and waiting until fully incorporated before adding more. Periodically stop and scrape the bowl to make sure everything
is mixing evenly. Mix until frosting is smooth, creamy, and fluffy.

### Step 8

If the frosting seems too soft, refrigerate about 10 minutes to firm up, then mix another minute or two.

### Step 9

Pipe or spread frosting onto the cooled cupcakes.

### Step 10

For the best eating experience, these cupcakes should be enjoyed the day they are made—and enjoy you will!
