## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 9 inch plate
- 1 rolling pin
- 1 wire rack
- 1 large saucepan
- 1 knife or spatula

## :pencil: Instructions - Dough

### Step 1

Mix all-purpose flour and salt in a food processor. Add chilled vegetable shortening and pulse until the mixture
resembles coarse sand. Scatter 1/4 inch butter pieces over the mixture and pulse until it becomes pale yellow and the
butter pieces are no larger than small peas. Pour mixture into a medium bowl.

### Step 2

Sprinkle 4 Tbsp of ice water over the mixture. Using a rubber spatula, fold the mixture to combine. Press down on the
dough until it sticks together, adding another tablespoon of ice water if necessary. Flatten the dough into a 4-inch
disk. Wrap in plastic and place in the refrigerator for at least an hour or up to 2 days.

### Step 3

Remove dough from the refrigerator and let stand at room temperature until malleable. Roll the dough on a lightly
floured surface or between two sheets of parchment paper until it becomes a 12 inch circle. Transfer to a 9 inch plate
by rolling the dough around the rolling pin and unrolling it over the plate. Ease the dough into the corners of the
plate by gently lifting the edge of the dough with one hand, while pressing into the bottom of the pan with the other
hand. Trim the dough edges so they extend about 1/2 inch beyond the rim of the plate. Fold the overhang over onto itself
and either flute the dough or press down with fork tines, to flatten the edges against the plate. Refrigerate for about
40 minutes, then place in the freezer until very cold, about 20 minutes.

### Step 4

Place a rack on the lower-middle position and heat to 375°F. Remove the dough from the freezer, put a double lined
12-inch piece of aluminum foil inside the pie shell and fold the foil over the fluted edges to shield from overcooking.
Put 2 cups of pie weights over the foil. Bake until the dough looks dry and is light in color, approximately 25 to 30
minutes. Carefully remove the foil and pie weights by pulling at the corners and pulling up. Place back into the oven
for about 12 minutes to complete the bake. When done, transfer to a wire rack.

### Step 5

Mix sugar, cornstarch, salt, and cold water in a large saucepan. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat,
whisking occasionally at the beginning, then more frequently as the mixture thickens. When the mixture starts to
thicken, whisk in egg yolks, two at a time. Whisk lemon zest and lemon juice (2-3 lemons), ending with the butter. Whisk
constantly and bring to a simmer. Remove from heat and place plastic wrap directly on the surface of the filling to
prevent a skin from forming.

### Step 6

Spread the prepared filling in the shell and bake for 10 to 15 minutes or until the filling is just set. Remove pie and
return oven to 375°F.

### Step 7

While pie is baking, make the meringue. Beat the egg whites until frothy, add the cream of tartar and continue beating
until rounded peaks form. Beat in superfine sugar and vanilla.

### Step 8

Spread the meringue over the filling, making sure it meets the edges of the crust to make a seal. Swirl in a design with
a knife or spatula and bake for about 10 minutes, or until the meringue is lightly browned.

### Step 9

Allow to cool completely (1-2 hours), but do not refrigerate.
