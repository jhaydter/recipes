## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Heat oven to 375°F. Combine graham cracker crumbs, melted unsalted butter, and 3 tablespoons granulated sugar in a
medium bowl; mix well. Press into a 9-inch pie plate, and bake until lightly browned, about 12 minutes. Remove from
oven, and transfer to a wire rack until completely cooled.

### Step 2

Lower oven to 325°F. In a medium bowl, gently whisk together sweetened condensed milk, egg yolks, Key lime juice, and
key lime zest. Pour into the prepared, cooled crust.

### Step 3

Return pie to oven, and bake until the center is set but still quivers when the pan is nudged, 15 to 17 minutes. Let
cool completely on a wire rack.

### Step 4

Shortly before serving, combine heavy cream and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted
with a whisk attachment. Whisk on medium speed until soft peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes. Spoon over cooled pie; garnish
with zest. Serve immediately.
