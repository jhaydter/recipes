## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Make the Pudding: Place the dates and baking soda in a heat-proof bowl or measuring cup. Pour boiling water over and
press the dates down with a spoon so they’re submerged. Let sit for 10 minutes.

### Step 2

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (alternatively, a large bowl and a hand mixer), cream
butter and light brown sugar on high until light and fluffy, about 1 minute. Reduce speed to medium, add the egg and
continue to mix until combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. With the mixer on low, add all-purpose
flour and baking powder and mix until just combined.

### Step 3

Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).

### Step 4

Puree the dates using a blender or immersion blender. Pour the mixture directly into the bowl of the stand mixer mix on
low until well combined.

### Step 5

Grease and flour a 6 cup muffin tin. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cavities and place in the oven. Bake
for 17 to 19 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out mostly clean. Allow the cakes to cool for about
5 minutes before turning out onto a plate or tray.

### Step 6

While the cakes are baking, make the Toffee Sauce: combine unsalted butter, brown sugar, milk, heavy cream, corn syrup,
and salt (except bourbon) in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar, and boil
for 3 minutes until thickened. Remove from heat, stir in bourbon, and allow to cool slightly before spooning over the
puddings. Serve immediately.

!!! note

    A standard 12-cup muffin tin can of course be used, simply grease and flour only 6 of the cavities. The
    recipe also easily doubles to make 12 puddings.
