## :cooking: Cookware

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Microwave the [chocolate pizzelle cookies][1], one at a time, for 45 seconds until pliable. Let them cool in a taco
holder (or just hold them with your hands for 30 seconds until they set).

### Step 2

Fill your shells with fudge ripple ice cream. I found a piping bag to be easiest here.

### Step 3

Roll your tacos in chopped peanuts.

### Step 4

Dip the top of your taco in melted chocolate. Freeze until set.
