## :pencil: Instructions - Cookies

### Step 1

Put dark corn syrup, unsalted butter, cut into pieces and granulated sugar into heavy-bottomed pan. Heat mixture over
low heat, stirring, until butter has melted and mixture is smooth. Don’t let mixture boil. Remove from heat and
vigorously stir in all-purpose flour, beating until smooth. (Rotary beater will do this easily.)

### Step 2

Drop batter by 1/2 teaspoons on greased baking sheets. Try doing only 5 cookies at a time, until you see how much they
spread. Bake at 350°F until cookies turn nice medium caramel color, about 5 to 7 minutes. Cookies should spread into
about 2.5 inch rounds, or little larger, and bubble.

### Step 3

Remove from oven and cool until cookies are firm enough to lift off baking sheet with spatula. Roll with fingers or
around clean broom handle into tubes about 3/4 inch around.

### Step 4

If cookies get too firm to manage, return to oven 1 to 2 minutes to soften. If batter in pan gets too stiff to use,
heat, stirring, until melted enough to drop from teaspoon.

electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and whip until it forms soft peaks. Add the brandy and mix in.

### Step 6

Pipe the brandy whipped cream into the rolled cookies.
