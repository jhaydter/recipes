## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

For the vanilla custard, pour the whole milk into a pan with the vanilla seeds and vanilla pod and place over a low heat
until just simmering. Remove from the heat.

### Step 2

In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks, granulated sugar and cornflour together until pale and creamy.

### Step 3

Remove the vanilla pod from the warm milk. (You can rinse this off to use in making vanilla sugar.)

### Step 4

Stir the warm milk slowly into the egg mixture. Pour the mixture back into the pan and cook over a low heat for 4 to 5
minutes, whisking, until the mixture thickens. (It should be very thick.)

### Step 5

Remove from the heat and beat in the unsalted butter until melted and incorporated. Transfer to a bowl, cover the
surface with clingfilm to prevent a skin forming and leave to cool. Set aside to chill in the fridge.

### Step 6

For the jam, tip the raspberries into a deep saucepan with the jam sugar and two tablespoons of water. Cook gently over
a low heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved. Bring the mixture to the boil and boil vigorously for
about 4 minutes, or until the temperature reaches 104°C / 219°F on a sugar thermometer. Transfer to a heatproof bowl
and leave to cool completely.

### Step 7

For the sponge, preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) / 160°C (fan) / Gas 4. Grease and line the base of a 23cm/9 inch
springform tin with baking parchment.

### Step 8

Put the eggs and granulated sugar into a large bowl and using an electric mixer, whisk together until the mixture is
very pale and thick and the whisk leaves a trail on the surface when lifted. This will take about 5 minutes.

### Step 9

Sift the cornflour, all-purpose flour and baking powder over the egg mixture and carefully fold in using a large metal
spoon. Fold in the melted unsalted butter, taking care not to over mix.

### Step 10

Pour the mixture into the lined tin and bake for 25 30 minutes until the sponge is golden-brown and has just started to
shrink away from the sides of the tin. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool. When cool enough to handle, turn out
on to a wire rack to cool completely.

### Step 11

For the fondant rose, roll 10 little pieces of pink fondant into small balls about the size of a cherry stone.

### Step 12

Dust two small pieces of greaseproof paper with confectioners' sugar and one by one, place the balls of fondant between
the sheets of greaseproof and flatten each ball out with your fingers, to a thin circle, approximately 2 cm / 1 inch in
diameter. These form the petals. Roll the first petal up like a sausage to form a bud and wrap the remaining petals
around the bud to make a rose. Bend and curl the edges of the petals, to make them look more realistic. Leave to dry for
at least 1 hour.

### Step 13

To assemble the cake, using a serrated knife, cut the cake horizontally into three even layers. Place one of the sponges
onto a serving plate. Spread a very thin layer of custard over the base of the first sponge.

### Step 14

Spoon a quarter of the custard into a piping bag fitted with a small plain nozzle and pipe a border around the edge of
the sponge – this is to contain the jam.

### Step 15

Spoon the jam over the sponge, and spread evenly within the border.

### Step 16

In a bowl, whip 600 ml / 20 fl-oz of the heavy cream to firm peaks. Fold half of the whipped cream into the remaining
custard.

### Step 17

Spread one-third of the custard cream over the jam.

### Step 18

Place the second sponge on top and spread over the remaining custard cream.

### Step 19

Place the third sponge on top. Spoon over the remaining whipped cream covering the sides and smoothing into a small dome
shape on the top. Set aside in the fridge for an hour.

### Step 20

For the marzipan, mix the ground almonds, granulated sugar, confectioners' sugar in a mixer fitted with a dough hook,
before adding the eggs and almond extract.

### Step 21

Knead in the bowl until it forms a stiff dough. Turn out onto a surface dusted with icing sugar. Using a cocktail stick
add a tiny amount of green food coloring paste and knead to an even pastel green color.

### Step 22

Roll out the marzipan on a surface lightly dusted with icing sugar, to a 40 cm / 16 in diameter circle, large enough to
cover the cake. Lift the marzipan up over the cake and using your hands, shape the marzipan around the sides of the cake
to get a smooth finish. Trim any excess.

### Step 23

Whip the remaining 150 ml / 5.5 fl-oz of cream to medium peaks and spoon into a piping bag fitted with a small star
nozzle. Pipe around the base of the cake.

### Step 24

Spoon the melted chocolate into a small paper piping bag. Snip off the end and pipe a swirl over the top of the cake.
Top with the fondant rose.

!!! tip

    The custard, jam, fondant roses and marzipan can all be made the day before, leaving you time to rest up before the
    assembly. If you used store-bought jam and marzipan, we wouldn’t hold it against you.
