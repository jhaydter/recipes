## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease and flour a 10-inch tube pan.

### Step 2

Cream the unsalted butter and granulated sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment for 4
to 5 minutes, until light. Add the eggs one at a time, then add the vanilla and sour cream. In a separate bowl, sift
together the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. With the mixer on low, add the flour mixture to the
batter until just combined. Finish stirring with a spatula to be sure the batter is well mixed.

### Step 3

For the streusel, place the light brown sugar, all-purpose flour, cinnamon, salt, and cold unsalted butter in a bowl and
pinch together with your fingers until it forms a crumble. Mix in the walnuts.

### Step 4

Spoon half the batter into the pan and spread it out with a knife. Sprinkle with 3/4 cup streusel. Spoon the rest of the
batter in the pan, spread it out, and scatter the remaining streusel on top. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes, until a cake
tester comes out clean.

### Step 5

Allow to cool on a wire rack for 30 minutes. Carefully transfer the cake, streusel-side up, onto a serving plate. Whisk
the confectioners' sugar and maple syrup together, adding a few drops of water, if necessary, to make the glaze thick
but runny. Drizzle the glaze over the cake with a small spoon. Serve at room temperature.

### Step 6

!!! note

    If you don’t have cake flour, you can substitute 2.25 cups all-purpose flour plus 1/4 cup cornstarch.

!!! note

    If the eggs are cold, place the whole eggs in a bowl of warm water for 5 minutes before cracking them.
