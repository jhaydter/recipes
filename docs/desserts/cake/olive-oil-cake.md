## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350Â°F. Lightly grease 6-inch round cake pan. Line bottom with
6-inch parchment paper round and line sides with two 10-inch strips of parchment. Spray parchment lightly, Whisk
all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt together in bowl.

### Step 2

Using handheld electric mixer, mix 1/2 cup sugar, egg, and lemon zest in bowl on low speed until combined. Increase
speed to high and whip until mixture is fluffy and pale yellow, about 2 minutes. Reduce speed to medium and, with mixer
running, slowly pour in olive oil. Mix until oil is fully incorporated, about 30 seconds. Add half of flour mixture and
mix on low speed until incorporated, about 30 seconds. Add milk and mix until combined, about 30 seconds. Add remaining
flour mixture and mix until just incorporated, about 30 seconds, scraping down bowl as needed.

### Step 3

Transfer batter to prepared pan. Sprinkle remaining 2 teaspoons sugar over entire surface. Bake until cake is deep
golden brown and toothpick inserted in center comes out with few crumbs attached, about 30 minutes. Transfer pan to wire
rack and let cool for 15 minutes. Gently invert pan onto rack; remove all parchment and reinvert. Let cake cool
completely, about 1 hour. Cut into wedges and serve. (Cake can be wrapped in plastic wrap and stored at room temperature
for up to 3 days.)
