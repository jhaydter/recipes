## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 350°F. Prepare two 9-inch round cake pans. Grease them with butter or cooking spray, line them with
parchment paper, grease them again and then dust the pans lightly with flour.

### Step 2

In a large mixing bowl, or the bowl of a stand mixer, cream the unsalted butter and sugar until light yellow and fluffy,
3 to 5 minutes. Crack the eggs into a separate bowl. With the mixer running on medium, add in the eggs one at a time,
scraping down the bowl once during mixing. Mix in the vanilla and almond extracts.

### Step 3

In a separate bowl, sift together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. With the mixer running on
low, add in a third of the flour. Next add in half of the milk and another third of the flour. Add the remaining milk,
and then finish with the rest of the flour. Mix until the batter is just combined. Do not overmix.

### Step 4

Fold in the 4 ounces of sweetened shredded coconut with a rubber spatula.

### Step 5

Pour batter evenly into the two prepared pans and smooth the top with a knife or flat spatula. Put the cakes in the
center of the oven. Check the cakes after 35 minutes, and continue baking as needed. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes until the
tops are browned and a cake tester comes out clean. Cool on a baking rack for 30 minutes. Turn the cakes out onto a
baking rack to finish cooling.

### Step 6

For the frosting, add the softened cream cheese, unsalted butter, vanilla extract and almond extract in a large mixing
bowl, or the bowl of a stand mixer. Mix on low until combined. Mix in the confectioners’ sugar until just smooth.

### Step 7

Place one cake layer on a flat serving plate or cake stand, top side down. Use a sharp knife to cut off the top; even it
off if necessary. Spread frosting over top. Place the second layer on top, top side up, and frost the top and sides. To
decorate the cake, sprinkle the top with sweetened shredded coconut and lightly press more coconut onto the sides. Serve
at room temperature. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge.
