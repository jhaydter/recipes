## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 350Â°F. On parchment paper, trace the bottom of a 5" round and cut out three circles. Place the
parchment paper into 3 different 5" round pans and grease or spray.

### Step 2

In a medium bowl, sift the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt together. Set aside.

### Step 3

In a large bowl with a hand mixer or stand mixer, add the unsalted butter. Cream (mix) for 1 minute. Add in the maple
syrup and beat for 1 minute, scraping down the sides as needed. Add in the applesauce and beat for 1 minute, scraping
down the sides as needed. Add in the eggs, milk, and vanilla and mix for 1 to 2 minutes.

### Step 4

Add in the flour mixture, and mix until just incorporated.

### Step 5

Divide the batter equally between the 3 round pans. Bake for 22 to 26 minutes or until golden brown around the edges and
a toothpick comes out clean when inserted in the center.

### Step 6

Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then invert layers onto a cooling rack, remove the parchment paper,
and set aside to cool completely.

### Step 7

In a large bowl with a hand mixer or stand mixer, add in the cream cheese, plain whole milk Greek yogurt, maple syrup,
and vanilla extract and beat on medium-high for 3 to 4 minutes or until soft and smooth. If too thick, you may need to
add in 1-2 tablespoons of milk.

### Step 8

Divide the frosting into two bowls and add in the freeze-dried strawberry into one of them. Mix until incorporated.

### Step 9

Place one of the round cakes on a serving platter and top with 1/2 cup of strawberry frosting, spreading the frosting to
the edges. Add on the second round cake, and spread 1/2 cup of frosting. Add on the third round cake.

### Step 10

Add on the white cream cheese frosting generously to the top and top half of the sides in the tiered cake. Take the rest
of the strawberry frosting and starting on the bottom of the cake and working your way up to the top mix the two
frostings together in the middle of the cake creating an ombre effect.
