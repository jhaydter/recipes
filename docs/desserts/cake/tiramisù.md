## :pencil: Instructions - Ladyfingers

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 350°F. Line 3 baking sheets with parchment paper. Trace the bottom of an 8 x 8 or 9 x 9 square pan or
9 round cake pan on each piece of parchment paper. Set aside.

### Step 2

In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the wire whisk attachment (or in a large bowl with a hand-held mixer), whip
egg yolks and 1/4 cup of granulated sugar with an electric mixer until thick and pale. Transfer mixture to a different
bowl, scraping the bowl clean. Rinse off the beater.

### Step 3

In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the wire whisk attachment (or in a large bowl with a hand-held mixer), whip
egg whites. Once the mixture starts to thicken, add the remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar and continue beating. Once
stiff peaks form add vanilla and beat to combine.

### Step 4

Gently stir in egg yolk mixture on low speed.

### Step 5

Add all-purpose flour and salt and gently stir or fold in with a spatula. The batter should be thick and pale yellow.

### Step 6

Pour about 1 cup of batter into the center of each square traced on the parchment paper. Evenly spread it out to fit the
square, leaving about 1/4 inch border. The batter should be about 1/2 inch thick.

### Step 7

Sprinkle confectioners' sugar on top of the ladyfinger batter to get a nice golden top.

### Step 8

Bake in preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes, until set and very lightly browned. Carefully transfer parchment paper to a
wire rack to cool.

### Step 9

Once cooled, carefully remove the lady finger squares from the parchment paper, set aside to use in the recipe.

### Step 10

Brew coffee. Let cool. (or use instant coffee or instant espresso and brew 1 3/4 cups).

### Step 11

Whisk the rum (optional) into the coffee, then pour the mixture into a large dish or baking pan that will fit the
layers. Set aside.

### Step 12

In a medium saucepan, whisk together egg yolks, whole milk and granulated sugar until combined.

### Step 13

Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until mixture boils. Turn heat to medium low and boil for 1 minute, remove
from heat and transfer the mixture to a container with lid, but don't put the lid on yet. Leave the lid open and whisk
the mixture every few minutes until it’s cooled slightly. Then put the lid on and chill in the refrigerator for 1
hour.

!!! note

    This can be done before you bake the lady fingers, if desired, so it has time to cool. It can even be done the day
    before and chilled overnight.

### Step 14

In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the wire whisk attachment (or in a large bowl with a hand-held mixer), Beat
the heavy whipping cream and confectioners' sugar until stiff peaks form, transfer to a different bowl.

### Step 15

In the same bowl used to beat whipping cream (but with the cream no longer in it), beat the chilled custard mascarpone
and vanilla with the paddle attachment until combined.

### Step 16

Gently fold in beaten whipping cream.

### Step 17

Add cooled custard mixture and beat until combined. Set aside.

### Step 18

Quickly dip one of the three lady finger layers into the soaking liquid for about 5 to 10 seconds. Do not drop it in
and let it sit or it will soak up too much liquid and fall apart. Remember, homemade lady fingers are more delicate
than store-bought. If using hard store-bought you will need to soak them longer.

### Step 19

Place it in the bottom of the baking dish you used to trace the shape.

### Step 20

Spread 1/3 of the filling mixture evenly on top of the layer.

### Step 21

Repeat with the second and third lady finger layers and remaining custard. Alternating soaked lady finger, custard,
soaked lady finger, custard.

### Step 22

Sprinkle unsweetened cocoa powder over the top custard layer.

### Step 23

Chill for at least 8 hours, or overnight.

### Step 24

Cut into square portions and serve.
