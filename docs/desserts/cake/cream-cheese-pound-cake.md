## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Start by preheating your oven to 325Â°F then liberally spray a 12 cup bundt pan with non-stick baking spray or greasing
with butter or shortening and then flour.

### Step 2

In your mixer bowl, add unsalted butter, oil or shortening, and cream cheese and beat for 2 minutes on high speed.
Slowly add in granulated sugar beat on high speed for an additional 7 minutes until very pale yellow and fluffy. There
is no leavening in this cake because we add ample air to this cake by having a very long creaming period.

### Step 3

Next, add eggs, one at a time, combining well after each addition and scraping down the sides as needed.

### Step 4

Turn your mixer down to its lowest speed, and slowly add cake flour into batter in two increments then add salt. Be
careful not to overbeat.

### Step 5

Lastly, add in vanilla extract, scrape down sides and mix until just combined and turn off mixer.

### Step 6

Pour cake batter into prepared bundt pan, and bake for 1 hour and 15 to 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the
center of the cake comes out clean.

### Step 7

Cool in pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then invert cake on serving plate for at least 1 hour or until the cake is
cool to the touch.

### Step 8

Dust with confectioners' sugar and serve.
