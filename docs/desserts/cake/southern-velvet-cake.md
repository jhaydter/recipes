## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 325Â°F.

### Step 2

Generously grease and flour (2) 9 inch round cake pans. Set aside.

### Step 3

In a medium bowl, whisk together all-purpose flour, baking soda, baking powder, unsweetened cocoa powder, and salt. Set
aside.

### Step 4

In a large bowl, combine the granulated sugar and vegetable oil.

### Step 5

Mix in the eggs, buttermilk, vanilla, and 1 to 2 oz of red food coloring until combined.

### Step 6

Stir in the plain hot coffee and white vinegar.

### Step 7

Combine the wet ingredients with the dry ingredients a little at a time, mixing after each addition, just until
combined. (Batter will be thin)

### Step 8

Pour the batter evenly into each pan.

### Step 9

Bake in the middle rack for 30 to 40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with moist crumbs
clinging to it. Do not overbake as the cake will continue to cook as it cools.

### Step 10

Let pans cool on a cooling rack until the pans are warm to the touch.

### Step 11

Slide a knife or offset spatula around the inside of the pans to loosen the cake from the pan.

### Step 12

Gently remove the cakes from the pan and let them finish cooling. (The warm cake will be very delicate)

### Step 13

Frost the cake with [cream cheese frosting][1] when the cakes have cooled completely.
