- 1 cooling rack

## :pencil: Instructions - Cake

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 325°F. Lightly grease two 9" round pans or line with parchment paper rounds.

### Step 2

Beat the granulated sugar and eggs together until they're light and fluffy, about 2 minutes at medium-high speed using
an electric or stand mixer. Slowly beat in the vegetable oil.

### Step 3

Weigh your all-purpose flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.

### Step 4

Add the flour, salt, and baking powder to the egg mixture in the bowl, beating just enough to combine. Scrape the bottom
and sides of the bowl, then beat again, to fully incorporate any sticky bits.

### Step 5

In a saucepan set over medium heat, bring the unsalted butter and whole milk just to a boil. Add the vanilla. Remove the
pan from the heat, and stir the mixture until the butter is completely melted.

### Step 6

Slowly add the hot milk mixture to the cake batter, mixing until everything is well combined. Scrape the bowl and mix
briefly, just until smooth. The batter will be very thin.

### Step 7

Divide the batter evenly among the prepared pans.

### Step 8

Bake the cakes for 30 to 35 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, and the top feels set.
Remove the cakes from the oven, cool them in the pans for 10 minutes, then turn them out onto a cooling rack to cool
completely.

### Step 9

In a medium-sized saucepan, stir together 2 cups (454g) of the whole milk, the granulated sugar, and the salt. Bring to
a simmer over medium heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar.

### Step 10

Meanwhile, whisk the cornstarch, egg yolks, and whole egg with the remaining 1/2 cup (113g) milk.

### Step 11

Whisk about half of the hot milk mixture into the egg yolks/cornstarch to temper the yolks. This keeps them from turning
to scrambled eggs when you add them to the simmering milk.

### Step 12

Pour the egg/milk mixture back into the remaining simmering milk in the pan, pouring it through a strainer to capture
any bits of egg.

### Step 13

Bring the mixture to a low boil over medium heat (this may happen very quickly), stirring constantly with a whisk, and
cook for 2 minutes; the mixture will thicken significantly.

### Step 14

Remove the filling from the heat and stir in the vanilla.

### Step 15

Transfer the filling to a heatproof bowl, and top it with a piece of buttered plastic wrap (make sure it touches the top
of the filling so it doesn't develop a skin). Refrigerate until cool.

### Step 16

When the cakes and pastry cream are completely cool, spread the filling in an even layer over one layer then stack the
second layer on top. Set aside.

### Step 17

Melt the semisweet chocolate and heavy cream together until smooth and lump-free. Add the vanilla and stir well. Let
the glaze sit for about 10 minutes to cool a bit and to thicken just a touch. Pour the glaze over the filled cake.
Serve immediately, or cool to room temperature, and refrigerate until ready to serve.

## :pencil: Instructions - Storage

### Step 18

Store any leftovers in the fridge, well wrapped in plastic.
