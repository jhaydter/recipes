## :pencil: Instructions - Nougat

### Step 1

Line a 9 X 4 inch loaf pan with parchment paper.

### Step 2

In a medium saucepan, warm the honey over medium-high heat until it registers 255°F on a candy thermometer.

### Step 3

In a separate medium saucepan, combine the 1.33 cups granulated sugar, corn syrup, and water and cook over medium-high
heat until the mixture registers 285°F, swirling occasionally.

### Step 4

Meanwhile, in the clean, dry bowl of a stand mixer, whip the egg white and remaining 1 Tbsp granulated sugar on low
speed with the whisk attachment until foamy. With the mixer running, slowly pour in the warm honey, followed by the hot
sugar syrup. Continue beating on low speed for 5 minutes more, until the mixture is lukewarm. Meanwhile, heat the
unblanched almonds and pistachios in a medium frying pan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until warm to the
touch.

### Step 5

To check if the nougat is ready, scoop up a small amount with a spoon and dip it into cold water; it should form a firm
ball. Add the warm nuts to the nougat and fold with a spatula until well combined.

## :pencil: Instructions - Finishing

### Step 6

Spoon the nougat into the prepared loaf pan, cover, and allow to cool overnight at room temperature.

### Step 7

The next day, remove the nougat from the pan and, with a serrated knife, cut it lengthwise into 6 slices.

### Step 8

Wrap each slice in plastic wrap to protect it from humidity. (Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week.)
