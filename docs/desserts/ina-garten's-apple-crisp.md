## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 350°F and butter or grease a baking dish (Ina’s recipe uses a 14 x 9 in oval baking dish). Peel
and core the apples and cut them into large wedges. Mix the apples with the orange zest, lemon zest, orange juice, lemon
juice, sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg. Pour the mixture into the dish.

### Step 2

Combine the all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, brown sugar, salt, quick-cooking oats and cold butter in the bowl of a
stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on low speed until the mixture is crumbly and the butter is the size
of peas.

### Step 3

Scatter the oat topping evenly over the apples. Place the baking dish on a sheet pan and bake the crisp for 1 hour until
the top is brown and the apples are bubbly. Serve warm.
