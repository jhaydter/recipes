## :salt: Ingredients

- 0.33 cup coconut oil
- 3 Tbsp flaxseed
- 7.5 Tbsp water
- 0.25 cup maple syrup
- 1 cup applesauce
- 0.5 cup [brown sugar][1]
- 0.25 cup sugar
- 0.75 tsp salt
- 1.5 tsp baking soda
- 1.5 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 1 cup almond milk
- 1.5 cup grated carrot
- 1.5 cup almond flour
- 0.75 cup walnuts
- 1.5 cup gluten-free flour blend

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 large mixing bowl

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 350°F (176°C). Butter and flour two 8-inch, 1 9x13-inch, or 3 6-inch round pans with coconut oil or
vegan cooking spray and dust with gluten-free flour (adjust number/size of pans if altering batch size). Shake out
excess. Set aside.

### Step 2

Prepare flax eggs in a large mixing bowl by mixing flaxseed and water and let rest for 5 minutes. To the flax eggs, add
oil and maple syrup and whisk to combine. Next, add applesauce, brown sugar, sugar, salt, baking soda, baking powder,
and cinnamon and whisk to combine.

### Step 3

Add lesser amount of almond milk (3/4 cup or 180 ml as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and
stir. Add grated carrot and stir. Then add almond flour and gluten-free flour blend and stir. The batter should be thick
but pourable. If too thick, add remaining almond milk 1/4 cup or 60 ml as original recipe is written // adjust if
altering batch size). If adding chopped walnuts, add at this time and stir.

### Step 4

Divide evenly among cake pan(s). Bake for 40 to 50 minutes or until deep golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the
center comes out clean. When you press on the top, it shouldn’t feel too spongy, so don’t be afraid of over-baking!
The gluten-free flour blend just takes a little longer to bake. Also, note that the size of pan you use will vary baking
time.

### Step 5

Remove from oven and let rest in the pans for 15 minutes. Then carefully run a knife along the edges and gently invert
onto cooling racks to let cool completely.

!!! note

    This cake needs to cool completely. It benefits from plenty of airflow, and the flavors develop as the cooling
    process goes on. If short on time, you can speed the cooling by placing the cakes in the refrigerator or freezer
    until very cool to the touch.

### Step 6

Once cooled, you can serve as is or frost! For frosting, you have several options! See options above.

### Step 7

Store leftovers at room temperature, covered, for 2-3 days, in the refrigerator for 3-4 days, or covered well in the
freezer for several weeks. However, it's best when eaten fresh.

!!! note

    Do note that, if using vegan cream cheese or yogurt in the frosting, the cake should be stored in the refrigerator.
    From the refrigerator, let set out for 10 to 15 minutes before serving so it warms a bit and becomes more tender.
    Let thaw completely from the freezer.
