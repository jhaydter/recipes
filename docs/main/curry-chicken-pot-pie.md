## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 400ÂºF. Unroll pie crusts, leaving plastic sleeves in place, and smooth together any cracks in the
dough. Use [hot water crust pastry][1] (alternative) as an alternative. Using a small cereal bowl and juice glass as
your guides, cut out 5 small circles and 5 medium circles from the dough. Cut a small vent hole in each of the small
circles and place them in refrigerator.

### Step 2

Line each ramekin with a medium-sized dough circle and place on rimmed baking sheet. Poke holes in the crusts with a
sharp knife. Place sheet on center rack of oven and par-bake crusts 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside.

### Step 3

Remove small pie crust circles from refrigerator. Add TJ's organic foursome vegetables and yellow onions to a
microwave-safe bowl and microwave 1 minute on high. Add chicken and TJ's Thai Yellow curry sauce to bowl and gently stir
to combine. Divide mixture among ramekins and top each with a small pie crust circle.

### Step 4

Return baking sheet to oven and bake 20 to 30 minutes, or until crusts are golden and filling is bubbling. Remove from
oven and let cool 5 minutes prior to serving.
