## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 400°F. Sauté onion & parsnips in oil for 5 minutes. Stir in squash. Cover and cook 5 minutes. Add kale
and salt, stir, cover and cook another 5 minutes or so until vegetables are tender. Add garbanzo beans, spicy pumpkin
curry simmer sauce and raisins, stir to combine. Cover and reduce heat to simmer 5 minutes. Remove from heat.

### Step 2

Remove pie crust from refrigerator. Lay crust on a clean work surface, smoothing any cracks with your hands. Grease a
9-inch pie plate with canola oil spray. Transfer simmered vegetables to pie plate. Top with pie crust, cutting three
oblong vents in center of crust.

### Step 3

Trim and seal crust edges (use a fork to crimp edges or use your hands for a more rustic look). In a small bowl, whisk
egg and 1 tablespoon water. Use a pastry brush to cover crust with egg wash.

### Step 4

Bake pie on center rack of oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until crust is a deep golden brown. Remove from heat and let
sit 15 minutes before serving.
