## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Pour the whole milk and heavy cream into a small pan over a low heat. Add the [vanilla paste][1] and bring slowly to a
simmer.

### Step 2

In a medium bowl, whisk the egg yolks and granulated sugar together until pale. Pour the mixture over the warm milk,
whisking continuously, then pour into a clean, heavy-based pan and cook over a very low heat.

### Step 3

Simmer the mixture gently for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring continuously, until smooth and thick enough to coat the back of a
spoon. Remove from the heat, cover the surface with clingfilm to prevent a skin forming, then leave to cool.
