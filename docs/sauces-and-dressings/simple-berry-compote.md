### Step 1

Place fruit and juice in a small saucepan and bring to medium heat.

### Step 2

Once bubbling, reduce heat slightly and use a wooden spoon to muddle and mash the fruit.

### Step 3

Continue cooking over medium-low heat for 10 to 12 minutes, occasionally mashing fruit to combine. Turn off heat and add
optional add-ins at this point (cinnamon (optional), ginger (optional), granulated sugar (optional), chia seeds

in ice cube molds up to 1 month. Reheat to serve with oats, pancakes, waffles, french toast, and more!
