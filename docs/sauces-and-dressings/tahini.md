| 15 minutes |

## :salt: Ingredients

- :seedling: 1 cup sesame seeds
- :carrot: 3 Tbsp vegetable oil
- :salt: 1 pinch salt

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 saucepan
- 1 baking sheet or large plate
- 1 food processor

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Add sesame seeds to a wide, dry saucepan over medium-low heat and toast, stirring constantly until the seeds become
fragrant and very lightly colored (not brown), 3 to 5 minutes. Careful here, sesame seeds can burn quickly.

### Step 2

Transfer toasted seeds to a baking sheet or large plate and cool completely.

### Step 3

Add sesame seeds to the bowl of a food processor then process until a crumbly paste, about 1 minute.

### Step 4

Add 3 tablespoons of the vegetable oil then process for 2 to 3 minutes more, stopping to scrape the bottom and sides of
the food processor a couple of times. Check the tahiniâ€™s consistency. It should be smooth, not gritty, and should be
pourable. You may need to process for another minute or add the additional tablespoon of oil.

### Step 5

Taste the tahini for seasoning then add salt to taste. Process 5 to 10 seconds to mix it in.

### Step 6

Store tahini covered in the refrigerator for one month. You may notice it separates over time, like a natural peanut
butter would. If this happens, give the tahini a good stir before using.
