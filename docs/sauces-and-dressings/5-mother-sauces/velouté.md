## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Make a [heavy blond roux][1].

### Step 2

Remove the medium saucepan from the heat and slowly whisk in 2.5 cup of [vegetable broth][2] along with minced
mushrooms.

### Step 3

Return the saucepan to the heat and bring the sauce slowly to a simmer, whisking to prevent lumps. Cook over medium-low
heat, stirring often and skimming any skin that forms on the surface, until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon,
about 20 minutes. Do not boil.

### Step 4

Strain through a fine-mesh sieve, if desired.

### Step 5

Season to taste with salt and pepper.

### Step 6

Just before serving, whisk in softened unsalted butter or any flavored butter.
