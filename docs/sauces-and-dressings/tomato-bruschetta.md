### Step 1

Core and chop the plum tomatoes, then transfer colander over a bowl or in the sink. Add the salt and gently stir. Let

Meanwhile, make the garlic oil: In a small saucepan, warm the olive oil and garlic, minced over low heat until the
garlic is softened and fragrant, about 5 minutes, making sure the garlic doesn't brown. Set aside to cool.

### Step 3

Roll the basil leaves up and thinly slice crosswise.

### Step 4

When the oil is cool and the tomatoes are well drained, combine the tomatoes, garlic oil and basil in a medium bowl.
Season with additional salt and pepper, to taste. Spoon over toasted bread.
