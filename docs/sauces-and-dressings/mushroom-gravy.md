## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Sauté the shallots and cremini mushroom over medium heat for 5 to 6 minutes. Add water 1 to 2 tablespoons at a time,
as needed, to keep them from sticking to the pan.

### Step 2

Add the garlic, thyme, sage, and rosemary, and cook for 1 minute more.

### Step 3

Add the dry white wine and cook until the wine is reduced by half, about 3 minutes.

!!!tip

    If using lemon juice instead of white wine, you do not need to reduce the sauce.

### Step 4

Make a purée from steamed cauliflower florets.

### Step 5

Add the cauliflower purée, vegetable broth, sea salt, black pepper, and nutritional yeast.

### Step 7

Whisk well and cook over medium heat for 10 minutes until the gravy thickens some.
