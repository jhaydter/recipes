## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

In a food processor or blender add the chile powder and carefully pour in 1.5 cups boiling water. Cover with lid to
steep while you get the other ingredients together.

### Step 2

Add the cider vinegar, chopped Roma tomatoes, garlic, brown sugar, oregano, salt, cumin, cinnamon, pepper and allspice
to the food processor or blender and process to a smooth purée, about the consistency of BBQ sauce or ketchup. If
needed, thin with water.

### Step 3

Heat olive oil in a skillet or Dutch oven over medium high heat. Carefully pour in the chili vegetable purée and bring
to a boil, reduce to simmer and cook for 20 minutes uncovered.

### Step 4

Makes about 2 1/2 to 3 cups adobo sauce. Use in any Mexican dish you prefer or add chipotle chiles (See below) and keep
in an airtight container and refrigerate.

### If Adding Chipotle Peppers in Adobo Sauce

#### If Using Dried Chipotle Peppers

Pre-soak: Bend and slightly crack the dried chipotle peppers (or make punctures all over with a knife). Add to a
saucepan and just cover with water. Bring to a boil, reduce to simmer and cook for 30 minutes. Be sure to add more water
if needed so they don't dry and burn.

Set aside to cool, then add to Adobo Sauce AFTER Step 3. Simmer in Adobo Sauce for another 10 minutes. Let cool
completely and store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.

#### If Using Freshly Smoked Chipotle Peppers (not dried yet)

Add freshly smoked peppers directly to the Adobo Sauce AFTER Step 3. Simmer in Adobo Sauce for another 10 minutes. Let
cool completely and store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.

### For Canning

Carefully spoon adobo sauce or adobo sauce with chipotles into clean, sterilized 4 ounce canning jars. Apply lid per
packaged instructions and submerge in boiling water for 30 minutes. Remove jars from water bath and allow to cool.

!!! note

    You can substitute ancho chile powder for regular chile powder.

!!! note

    If available use Mexican piloncillo. The sugar is found at most Mexican markets or in the Mexican aside of most
    markets and is formed into a cone shape. Break off and use 2 tablespoons.

!!! note

    I prefer Mexican oregano and it definitely adds so much authenticity to the recipe. Mexican oregano is a relative
    of Lemon Verbena and is native to Mexico. Similar in that it’s pungent like Mediterranean oregano, Mexican oregano
    has notes of mild licorice and citrus. Mediterranean oregano is a member of the mint family and most often is used
    in Greek and Italian recipes. Mediterranean oregano is the one most found in spice racks and supermarkets.
