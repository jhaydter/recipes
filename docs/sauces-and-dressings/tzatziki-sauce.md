## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Use the coarse side of a cheese grater to shred the peeled English cucumber. Place grated cucumber in a bowl and season
with 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Let it sit for 20 to 30 minutes. (This draws out the excess moisture.) Strain cucumber
through a wire sieve, cheese cloth, or paper towel and place in a mixing bowl.

### Step 2

Add garlic, full fat Greek yogurt, olive oil, Aleppo chiles, pepper, dill, lemon juiced and salt to taste and white
vinegar (optional) to taste and mix well.

### Step 3

Taste and adjust any extra salt, vinegar, or lemon juice to your liking.
