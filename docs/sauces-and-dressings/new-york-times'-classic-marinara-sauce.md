## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Pour tomatoes into a large bowl and crush with a fork. Pour 1 cup water into can and slosh it around to get tomato
juice. Reserve.

### Step 2

In a large skillet (do not use a deep pot) over medium heat, heat the oil. When it is hot, add garlic. As soon as the
garlic is sizzling (do not let it burn) add the tomatoes, water, chili pepper flakes or TJ's Bamba Hot Pepper Sauce,
oregano, and kosher salt. Stir.

### Step 3

Place the basil sprig (including stem) on the surface like a flower. Let it wilt, then submerge in sauce.

### Step 4

Simmer until sauce has thickened and oil on surface is a deep orange, about 10 minutes.

### Step 5

Taste and season as needed. Discard basil.
