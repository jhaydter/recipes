## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

In a sauce pan, heat 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, when hot, add shallots and cook until light golden brown and add the
mushrooms and the salt and cook until they have released most of their water (this could take 7 to 10 minutes).

### Step 2

Add the tarragon, garlic and when fragrant (about 15 to 20 seconds) add the Balsamic vinegar and red wine and let it
reduce until about half of it remain. Add vegetable stock, add salt and pepper to taste and cook for 15 to 20 minutes.
Add heavy cream and parsley if you like.

### Step 3

Adjust the thickness of the sauce with unsalted butter or cornstarch (optional) when boiling a little bit at a time and
at the last minutes add as much butter as you like. Chef adds at least 2 large tablespoons!!!
