## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

In a large skillet, cook the vegetarian sausage or soy chorizo (alternative) over medium heat until cooked through and
nicely browned, about 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer the sausage to a platter and set aside.

### Step 2

Make a [heavy blond roux][1] in the same pan as the sausage to incorporate the grease and browned bits.

### Step 3

Whisk in the whole milk, making sure to get any lumps out until the mixture is smooth. Add two pinches of nutmeg. Bring
to a simmer over medium heat and cook until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.

### Step 4

Stir the sausage into the gravy. Season generously with salt and pepper. Serve warm.

### Step 5

Store leftovers in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Reheat gently over low heat.

### Step 6

Can be served with [Jojo's biscuits][2].
