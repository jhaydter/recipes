My collection of recipes made with [cooklang][1].

The `cooklang` files are stored in the `cook` folder and the markdown files are stored
in the `docs` folder.

## :frame_with_picture:&nbsp; Background

This collection is a consolidation of recipes from many different sources to make it easier to reference in one
location and to guard against recipes disappearing from the Internet. The recipes are meant to be used for my
own personal reference.

!!! info

    Recipes, when applicable, have the original source specified to give them credit.

!!! warning

    Recipes on this site might be different than the sourced recipes due to personal modifications. E.g.
    changing the amount of chili powder to make the dish less spicy or [aging cookie dough][4] where egg white
    are the main liquid component in order to control spread and concentrate flavor.

## :gear:&nbsp; Development
