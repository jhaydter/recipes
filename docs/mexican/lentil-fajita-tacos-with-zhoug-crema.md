Combine 1/2 cup Greek yogurt with one to two tablespoons of Zhoug sauce, depending on how spicy youâ€™d like it, and

### Step 2

In a large skillet, over high heat, add olive oil. Add TJ's fire roasted peppers and onions to the pan, and cook until
heated through and sizzling, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add one tablespoon of Zhoug sauce and stir to combine. Add TJ's
steamed lentils, season with salt and pepper, and add the juice from the remaining half of lime. Continue to cook until
