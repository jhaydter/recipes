## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven at 400°F.

### Step 2

In a medium saucepan, sweat the onion, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic until they are aromatic, about 1 minute.

### Step 3

Simmer the black beans, vegetable stock, paprika, cumin, salt, and pepper for 15 minutes, until the liquid has almost
evaporated.

### Step 4

Add the unsalted butter, lime juice, and cilantro, and mash everything together with a potato masher.

### Step 5

Lay out the flour tortillas on a flat surface and divide the bean mixture among the 12 tortillas (about 3 tablespoons
for each). Roll up each tortilla tightly and place it seam side down.

### Step 6

Line a large baking tray with parchment paper or a silicone mat. Spread about 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil evenly
across it.

### Step 7

Place the taquitos seam side down on the baking tray, making sure that you are leaving at least 1/2 inch of space
between each one.

### Step 8

Using a pastry brush, brush a thin layer of oil on each taquito.

### Step 9

Bake at 400°F for 20 to 25 minutes, until the tortillas start to brown.
