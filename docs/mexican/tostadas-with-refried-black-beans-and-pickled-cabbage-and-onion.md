## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Heat the oven (with the oven rack in the middle) to 375°F.

### Step 2

Put the corn tortillas on a sheet pan and brush both sides with the olive oil. Bake 12 to 15 minutes, until crisp.

### Step 3

For the pickled cabbage and onion, as thinly as you can, slice the green cabbage, red onion, and jalapeño and put into
a medium bowl.

### Step 4

In a small saucepan, combine the white wine vinegar, water, sugar, and salt over medium-high heat. Let it come to a
boil. Once the sugar is dissolved, pour over the cabbage mixture and toss. Let cool to room temperature, stirring
occasionally, until wilted but still crisp (the cabbage mixture will slowly become submerged in the vinegar mixture as
it wilts).

### Step 5

For the beans, finely chop the yellow onion. In a medium saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the
onion and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 to 6 minutes, until softened. Add the cumin and cook, stirring,
for 30 seconds. Add the black beans, 1 cup water, and the chipotle powder. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 10
minutes. Use a potato masher or the back of a fork to mash the beans. Continue to simmer, stirring often, for 3 to 4
minutes, until the beans are thick.

### Step 6

Build your tostadas: Dividing evenly spread the beans over the tortillas. Add some slices of avocado (optional). Use
tongs to lift out some of the pickled cabbage mixture, shaking of excess vinegar mixture, and top the tostadas. Top with
cilantro as well.
