## :cooking: Cookware

- 2 large baking sheets
- 1 high-speed blender

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 400째F (204째C) and add bite-sized pieces of cauliflower to 2 large baking sheets (use more baking
sheets if increasing batch size). Add avocado or coconut oil (or omit or sub with water), cumin, chili powder, paprika,
and salt. Toss to combine and roast on the bottom rack for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown and tender.

### Step 2

To a separate baking sheet, add raw almonds and the 4 unpeeled garlic (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if
altering batch size). Roast on the center rack for 10 to 12 minutes, checking at the 8 minute mark. If the almonds are
dark brown and cracking, remove from the oven to avoid burning, but continue cooking garlic until light golden brown and
slightly softened. Remove from oven and set aside.

### Step 3

While cauliflower finishes roasting, add drained, fire-roasted tomatoes to a high-speed blender along with almonds,
roasted garlic (peeled), raw garlic (peeled), olive oil (or water), lime juice, paprika, cumin, salt, maple syrup, and
chipotle peppers in adobo sauce.

### Step 4

Blend on high until creamy and smooth, scraping down sides as needed. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more
lime for acidity, garlic for kick/zing, salt for saltiness, paprika or cumin for smokiness, maple syrup to offset
heat/add sweetness, or chipotle peppers for more heat.

### Step 5

To serve, warm tortillas in the microwave or in the oven directly on the still-warm oven racks until pliable. Then add
1-2 Tbsp of the romesco sauce and a generous portion of cauliflower. Serve as is or garnish with lime juice/wedges,
cilantro, thinly sliced red cabbage, and/or pepitas (optional).

### Step 6

Best when fresh. Store leftover sauce in the refrigerator up to 1 week (or 1 month in the freezer), and the cauliflower
in the refrigerator up to 3 days. Reheat cauliflower in a 350째F (176째C) oven until warm (best when fresh).
