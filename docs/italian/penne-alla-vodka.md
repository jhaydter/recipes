## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 375Â°F.

### Step 2

Heat the olive oil in a medium (11-inch) Dutch oven, such as Le Creuset, over medium-low heat. Add the onions and cook
for about 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent. Add the garlic, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook for just
1 minute.  Add the vodka and simmer for 5 to 7 minutes, until the mixture is reduced by half. With clean hands, crush
each whole tomato into the pot. Add 2 teaspoons of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper. Cover the pot with a
tight-fitting lid and bake for 1.5 hours.

### Step 3

Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add 2 tablespoons of salt and the penne pasta and cook according the
directions on the package. Drain and set aside.

### Step 4

Pour the tomato mixture into a food processor fitted with the steel blade and puree until smooth. (You can also use a
blender.) Return the tomato mixture to the pot. Add the fresh oregano, heavy cream, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 1/2 teaspoon
pepper and simmer partially covered for 10 minutes.  Add the pasta to the sauce and cook for 2 minutes.  Off the heat,
stir in 1/2 cup of the Parmesan cheese and serve hot sprinkled with extra Parmesan and fresh oregano.
