### Step 1

In a sauté pan, heat the unsalted butter, and when melted, add the finely diced red onion and cook for about 5 minutes
at medium heat. Add the mushrooms, salt, and pepper and sauté until they have released ALL their water.

### Step 2

Add the garlic and the fresh tarragon or sage or thyme or rosemary incorporate and add the spinach and cook until it is
wilted.

### Step 3

Add the vegetable stock and let it reduce for a minute. Add the heavy cream and let it reduce to the right thickness.
Make sure to cook until you have the perfect texture, which is to coat the pasta.
