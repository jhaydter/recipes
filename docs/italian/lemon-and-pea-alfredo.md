- :butter: 3 Tbsp unsalted butter
- :olive: 2 Tbsp olive oil
- :garlic: 1 clove garlic
- :cheese_wedge: 2.5 cup Parmesan

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the fusilli con buco pasta and cook until just short of
al dente, 10 or 11 minutes.

### Step 2

Meanwhile, heat a large straight-sided skillet over medium heat. Add the unsalted butter and olive oil to the hot
skillet. When the butter is melted, add the garlic; cook, stirring often, until soft and fragrant. Add 1/2 cup of the
pasta water, then reduce the heat to low.

### Step 3

When the pasta is ready, lift it out of the water and add it directly to the sauce; reserve the pasta water. Sprinkle
the Parmesan over the pasta and stir to combine. Return the heat to medium, add the mascarpone, lemon zest and 3/4
teaspoon salt and toss well. Continue cooking until the pasta is al dente, another minute or two, adding pasta water as
needed to thin the sauce.

### Step 4

Add the peas and lemon juice; toss well to combine. Add more pasta water as needed to reach the desired sauce
consistency (you will most likely use about 1.5 cups pasta water in all).

### Step 5

Sprinkle with the pink pepper and additional Parmesan, if desired.
