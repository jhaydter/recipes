## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

In a high-sided large (12-inch) skillet with a lid, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium. Add panko, season
with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring constantly, until golden and crispy, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate.
Set a large pot of salted water to boil.

### Step 2

Wipe out the skillet and heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium. Add finely chopped onion and cook, stirring
occasionally, until softened, about 2 minutes. Stir in minced garlic until fragrant, 30 seconds. Add eggplant and
drizzle over the remaining 4 tablespoons olive oil. Season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally,
until eggplant is softened, about 8 minutes. Add in tomato paste and stir constantly until lightly caramelized on the
bottom of the skillet, about 2 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes, basil sprig, dried oregano and 1½ cups of water, and
bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.

### Step 3

Cover the skillet and reduce heat to medium. Cook, stirring occasionally and smashing some of the cubed eggplant, until
the eggplant is very tender and the sauce is thickened, about 15 minutes. Discard the basil sprig.

### Step 4

Meanwhile, in the large pot of water, cook short pasta according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve ½ cup
of pasta water and drain.

### Step 5

Add cooked pasta, reserved pasta water and the eggplant sauce to the large pasta cooking pot, and cook over medium heat,
stirring, until sauce thickens and coats the pasta, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in ¼ cup of the chopped basil.

### Step 6

Add Parmigiano-Reggiano to the panko bread crumbs and mix well. Divide the pasta in bowls and top each with some of the
mozzarella. Sprinkle over cheesy bread crumbs, and garnish with the remaining basil.
