## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Cook fusilli pasta as per package instructions.

### Step 2

While pasta is cooking, get all ingredients ready – chop broccoli florets, half grape tomatoes, and grate Parmesan
cheese.

### Step 3

Reserve 1 cup of pasta water, draining the rest. Set aside.

### Step 4

Preheat large deep skillet or a dutch oven on medium heat, add olive oil and garlic. Sauté for 30 seconds, stirring
frequently.

### Step 5

Add 1 tbsp [pesto][1], tomatoes and stir. Cook for 1 – 2 minutes, stir and cook another 1 – 2 minutes.

### Step 6

Move to one side of the skillet and make sure the empty side of is positioned directly over heat. Add 1 tbsp [pesto][1]
and broccoli, stir and cook for 4 minutes, stirring once.

### Step 7

Remove skillet from heat and add remaining 1/4 cup [pesto][1], sun-dried tomatoes, half Parmesan cheese, salt, black
pepper, red pepper flakes, pasta and pasta water. Stir gently and let flavors marinate for a few minutes. Do not cover
because broccoli will become a mushy mess.
