## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat. Set aside.

### Step 2

Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the eggplant and cook, occasionally mashing it with the side
of a spatula or wooden spoon, for about 5 minutes, or until the eggplant starts to become tender. Add the onion and cook
for 4 to 5 minutes more, until the eggplant is cooked through and tender but still holds its shape.

### Step 3

Add the garlic, basil, oregano, thyme and black pepper and cook for 30 seconds.

### Step 4

Transfer the eggplant mixture to a large bowl. Mix in the nutritional yeast and bread crumbs. (Bread crumbs contain
different amounts of sodium, so it is important to taste the eggplant mixture before adding the salt.) Taste the
mixture and season with the salt. Allow the mixture to sit at room temperature until cool enough to handle before
forming the meatballs.

### Step 5

Using your hands and about 1½ tablespoons of the eggplant mixture for each, form 15 meatballs. Place the meatballs on
the prepared baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes. Flip them over and cook for about 10 minutes more, or until golden
brown on both sides.

### Step 6

Meanwhile, cook the spaghetti according to the package directions until it is al dente and heat the [marinara sauce][1]
in a medium saucepan over medium heat.

### Step 7

Allow the meatballs to cool for about 10 minutes. Transfer them to the saucepan with the marinara sauce. Heat gently
until warmed through before serving on top of the pasta and garnishing with parsley.
