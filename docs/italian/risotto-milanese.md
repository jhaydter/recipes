## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Combine and let stand for 10 minutes saffron threads and hot vegetable broth.

### Step 2

Pour into a saucepan, heat, and maintain at a simmer [vegetable broth][1].

### Step 3

Melt in a large heavy saucepan over medium-low heat 3 Tbsp butter.

### Step 4

Add and cook, stirring, until soft and translucent but not browned minced onion.

### Step 5

Stir in Arborio rice.

### Step 6

Continue to stir the rice until it is thoroughly coated and almost entirely opaque, 3 to 5 minutes. Add dry white wine.

### Step 7

Stir until absorbed. Add the saffron mixture and simmer, stirring often, until absorbed. Add the vegetable stock 1 cup
at a time, waiting for each cup to be absorbed before adding the next. Stir continuously and maintain a simmer. The
risotto is done when the rice is tender but firm; it should be creamy, not stiff. Fold in 1 to 1.5 cups grated Parmesan.

### Step 8

Season to taste with salt and pepper.

### Step 9

If desired, serve with grated Parmesan.
