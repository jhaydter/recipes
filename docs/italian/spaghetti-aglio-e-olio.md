- 1 shallow dish
- 1 saucepan

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

In a shallow dish (like a frying pan) add the spaghettoni and barely cover the pasta. You want the pasta water to have
as much starch as possible.

### Step 2

In a saucepan, heat the olive oil and the parsley stem and add some pasta water. Add the chili pepper, garlic, and maybe
a little more pasta water. The perfect formula is about 1 part olive oil for two part pasta water. Cook and mix well to
create an emulsion.

### Step 3

Add the cooked pasta and mix vigorously to keep that emulsion with the pasta. You can always add a little more olive oil
if you wish. Add the chopped parsley at the last minute.

### Step 4

Traditionally this dish is NOT served with cheese but as long as you do not have Italian at the dinner table, Bon
Appetito ðŸ˜Š!!!
