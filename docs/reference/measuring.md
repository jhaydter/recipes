## :old_key: A Translation of Old-Fashioned American Measurements

We shouldn’t give up our old measurements entirely. There’s too much history and sentiment tied up in them.
“Butter the size of a walnut” stirs a chord that “28.35g butter” just can’t. But where there are no walnuts, we need
the other measurement as well.

| Old-Fashioned Equivalent                  | Current             |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Butter the size of a walnut (or a “lump”) | 2 Tbsp              |
| Butter the size of an egg                 | 1/4 cup             |
| Coffee cup                                | 1 cup               |
| Dash                                      | 1/8 tsp             |
| Dessert spoon                             | 1-1/2 tsp           |
| 60 drops                                  | 1 tsp               |
| Gill                                      | 1/2 cup             |
| Pinch                                     | 1/16 or 1/8 tsp     |
| Salt spoon                                | 1/4 tsp             |
| Teacup                                    | 3/4 cup             |
| Tin cup                                   | 1 cup               |
| Tumblerful                                | 2 cups              |
| Wineglass                                 | 1/2 gill or 1/4 cup |

## :book: Using Cookbooks From Outside The United States[^2]

With the exception of the other English-speaking nations, cookbooks are written with metric measurements. Should
you run into a metric cookbook, here are some conversions of our basic measurements, which are difficult to translate
exactly. Small amounts will not make much difference, so metric amounts are usually rounded. (You use milliliters [ml]
when speaking of liquids, and grams [g] when speaking of solids.) For baking purposes, a gram is the same as a
milliliter.

| Imperial  | Metric              |
|-----------|---------------------|
| 1 tsp     | 5 ml/g              |
| 1 Tbsp    | 15 ml/g             |
| 1 ounce   | 28.35 (or 30) ml/g  |
| 1 cup     | 227 (or 230) ml/g   |
| 1 lb      | 450 ml/g            |
| 2.2 lbs   | 1 kilogram          |

And should you be faced with an overseas oven, here are some temperature conversions from Fahrenheit to centigrade,
with the gas marks, used in some countries, as well.

| Fahrenheit  | Celsius or Gas Mark   |
|-------------|-----------------------|
| 225°F       | 100°C or Gas Mark 1/4 |
| 250°F       | 130°C or Gas Mark 1/2 |
| 275°F       | 140°C or Gas Mark 1   |
| 300°F       | 150°C or Gas Mark 2   |
| 325°F       | 170°C or Gas Mark 3   |
| 350°F       | 180°C or Gas Mark 4   |
| 375°F       | 190°C or Gas Mark 5   |
| 400°F       | 200°C or Gas Mark 6   |
| 425°F       | 220°C or Gas Mark 7   |
| 450°F       | 230°C or Gas Mark 8   |
| 475°F       | 240°C or Gas Mark 9   |
