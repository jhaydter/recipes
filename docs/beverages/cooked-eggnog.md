### Step 1

Combine milk and heavy cream.

### Step 2

Whisk in a medium bowl just until blended egg yolks, sugar, and 1 tsp nutmeg.

### Step 3

Heat in a large saucepan over medium-low heat 2 cups milk and 2 cups heavy cream.

### Step 4

While whisking, slowly add part of the hot milk and cream mixture to the egg yolks. Then slowly pour the cream and egg
mixture back into the saucepan, stirring constantly, until the mixture becomes a little thicker and reaches a
temperature of about 175Â°F. Do not overheat or the mixture will curdle. Remove from heat and immediately stir in the
combined 1 cup milk and 1 cup heavy cream. Strain through a fine mesh strainer into a storage container and cool. Chill
thoroughly, uncovered, then stir in brandy, Cognac, dark rum, or bourbon.

### Step 5
