## :pencil: Instructions - Soup

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 350°F.

### Step 2

On medium heat, place a roasting tray on the hob. Add the garlic, red onions, and cayenne pepper first. Make sure your
onions are well coated with olive oil, and cook for 5 minutes. A pinch of salt and pepper, brown sugar, and balsamic
vinegar should be added to the tomatoes that have been cored and halved. Stir it well and bake for 25 minutes. Continue
cooking the tomatoes for another 5 minutes or until they begin caramelizing.

### Step 3

Remove the roasting tin from the oven after 25 minutes and place it back on the back burner at medium heat. Add the
vegetable stock and heat until boiling, then simmer for a few minutes. Stir in the heavy cream and simmer for 2 minutes
more.

### Step 4

If you prefer a chunky rustic soup, you can use a potato masher to ‘blend’ your soup to a thick consistency. The
flavors will all mix in your soup rather than if you blend it. Using a stick blender straight in the pan can achieve a
traditional cream blend.

### Step 5

In a pan, toast the pine nuts until golden brown and crispy.

### Step 6

Grind the sun-dried tomatoes in a mortar and pestle until you have an oily paste.

### Step 7

Add a pinch of pepper and the pine nuts, and continue grinding until you obtain the desired consistency for your pesto.

### Step 8

Grate the Parmesan cheese and add a dash of olive oil (add some tomato oil to give it a little extra flavor.) You should
have four heaping teaspoons to add to your tomato soup!
