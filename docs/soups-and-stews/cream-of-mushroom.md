## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Add the butter to a saucepan over medium-low heat.

### Step 2

When butter melts, add the shallots and cook (sweat) the shallots for 2 to 3 minutes while stirring. Avoid browning the
shallots.

### Step 3

Then add the button mushrooms and stir to combine with the shallots. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes.

### Step 4

When moisture starts to release from the mushrooms, season with salt and pepper. Continue cooking over medium-low heat
and keep stirring the mushrooms so they release most of their moisture (about 10 minutes). Turn the heat off when the
mushrooms just begin to dry and set them aside.

### Step 5

To make the béchamel sauce, start by preparing a roux. Add some unsalted butter to a small saucepan over medium-low
heat. When the butter melts, add the all-purpose flour and mix to combine. Cook for 2 minutes while stirring
occasionally and then turn the heat off and set the saucepan aside to allow the roux to cool.

### Step 6

Now you need to make a flavored milk for the béchamel. In another saucepan, add the whole milk, 2 small bay leaves, 1/2
onion with cloves, sea salt, black pepper and a pinch of freshly grated nutmeg. Place the saucepan over medium-high heat
and bring to a gentle boil while stirring. The flavored milk is ready when the onion starts "dancing" or bobbing around.

### Step 7

Remove the milk from heat and let it rest/infuse for 5 minutes. Remove the onion, cloves and bay leaves after infusing.

### Step 8

Add the roux to the flavored milk and whisk to combine.

### Step 9

Place the saucepan over medium heat and, while whisking constantly, bring the béchamel to a simmer. The sauce should
start to thicken slightly when ready.

### Step 10

Place a fine-mesh strainer over a pot of cooked mushrooms and slowly pour in the béchamel. Use a rubber spatula to help
scrape off any sauce stuck to the saucepan.

### Step 11

Mix to combine. Use a stick blender to further break down the mushrooms and help extract more flavor. Another round of
straining and pressing the mushrooms through the wire mesh sieve adds more flavor and smoothness to the soup.

### Step 12

To finish the soup, add 3 ounces of milk and some whipping cream and mix well to combine. Gently heat to a simmer over
medium heat. Adjust the seasoning to your taste.

### Step 13

This creamy mushroom soup can be served in a bowl with croutons, a small nub of butter and chopped parsley. A drizzle of
dry sherry or port wine (optional) further enhances the flavor.
