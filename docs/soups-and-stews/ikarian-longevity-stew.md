## :salt: Ingredients

- :herb: 2 bay leaves
- :canned_food: 8 oz black-eyed peas
- :seedling: 1 bunch chopped dill
- :garlic: 1 fennel bulb
- :garlic: 4 garlic

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Heat half the olive oil over medium heat and cook the red onion, garlic, and fennel bulb stirring occasionally, until
soft (about 12 minutes). Add the black-eyed peas and toss to coat in the oil.

### Step 2

Add the tomato, tomato paste and enough water to cover the beans by about an inch. Add the bay leaves. Bring to a boil,
reduce heat and simmer until the black-eyed peas are about half way cooked. (Check after 40 minutes, but it may take
over an hour.)

### Step 3

Add the chopped dill and season with salt.

### Step 4

Continue cooking until the black-eyed peas are tender. Remove, pour in remaining raw olive oil and serve.
