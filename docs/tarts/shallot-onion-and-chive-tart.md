## :pencil: Instructions - Shortcrust Pastry

### Step 1

To make the pastry, put the all-purpose flour into a bowl and mix in the salt. Add the cold unsalted butter and cold
vegetable shortening and rub into the flour with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.
Alternatively, do this in a food processor or mixer and then transfer to a bowl.

### Step 2

Now work in just enough (3 to 5 Tbsp) cold water to bring the dough together. When it begins to stick together, gently
knead it into a ball. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for around 30 minutes.

### Step 3

Meanwhile, for the filling, thinly slice the shallots and onions. Heat the unsalted butter and sunflower oil in a large
frying pan over a medium-low heat. Add the shallots and onions with a pinch of salt and cook slowly for at least 20
minutes, stirring occasionally, until they are very soft and golden. Season with pepper and more salt if needed. Leave
to cool.

### Step 4

Heat your oven to 200째C / gas 6 / 400째F and have ready a 23 cm loose-based fluted tart tin, 3.5 cm deep.

### Step 5

Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to a 3 mm thickness and use it to line the tart tin, leaving the excess
hanging over the edge. Keep a little uncooked pastry back in case you need to patch any cracks later. Prick the pastry
base with a fork. Line the pastry with baking parchment or foil and then fill with baking beans, or uncooked rice or
lentils.

### Step 6

Bake blind for 15 minutes, then remove the parchment and baking beans and return the pastry to the oven for about 8
minutes or until it looks dry and faintly colored. Trim away the excess pastry from the edge. Use a tiny bit of the
reserved raw pastry to patch cracks or holes if necessary. Turn the oven down to 180째C / gas 4 / 350째F.

### Step 7

For the filing, whisk the eggs, egg yolks and heavy cream together, then whisk in the wholegrain mustard and chives.
Season with salt and white pepper.

### Step 8

Spoon the cooled onion mixture into the pastry case and spread it evenly, then carefully pour on the egg mixture. Bake
in the oven for 30 to 35 minutes, until the filling is just set and golden. Leave in the tin for 5 minutes, then unmold.
Serve warm or cold..
