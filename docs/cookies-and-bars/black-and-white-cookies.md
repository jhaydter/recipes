## :pencil: Instructions - Cookies

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.

### Step 2

Whisk the all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl.

### Step 3

In a large bowl, mix the unsalted butter and granulated sugar with an electric mixer (stand or hand held) until fluffy,
about 2 minutes.

### Step 4

Add the eggs and egg yolk, one at a time, mixing between each addition. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl.

### Step 5

Add the flour in three steps, alternating with the buttermilk, added in two steps, mixing until just blended. Scrape
down the sides of the bowl. Mix in the vanilla and lemon zest.

### Step 6

Line baking sheets with parchment paper, and using a 1/4 cup ice cream scoop, scoop the batter onto the pans, allowing
about three inches between each cookie. You should get no more than six cookies per half sheet pan.

### Step 7

Bake the cookies, one sheet at a time, for 17 minutes. The edges should be slightly golden, and the center should spring
back when slightly touched.

### Step 8

Cool the cookies on the pan on a rack for 5 minutes, and then remove from the pan and cool on a cooling rack completely.

## :pencil: Instructions - Icing

### Step 9

To make the icing, mix the confectioners' sugar, 4 to 5 Tbsp milk, heavy cream, and vanilla. The icing should be
spreadable, but thin enough to not look like cake frosting.

### Step 10

Spread the vanilla frosting over half of the flat side of the cookie with an offset spatula. Let the frosting set for
about 20 minutes.

### Step 11

Add the dark cocoa powder to the rest of the icing and whisk. Add water, by the teaspoon, until you get a similar
consistency to the vanilla icing. Spread the chocolate icing over the other half of the cookie. Let the icing set or at
least 1 hour.

### Step 12

These cookies are best served within 24 hours, but will keep for up to three days if kept in an airtight container at
room temperature.
