### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 350°F and line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.

### Step 2

In a stand mixer fit the paddle attachment, combine the butter, light brown sugar, and molasses. Beat until light and
fluffy, about 3 minutes.

### Step 3

Use a rubber spatula to scrape the sides of the bowl and add the egg and the vanilla extract. Mix well.

### Step 4

In a separate bowl stir together the all-purpose flour, old fashioned oats, baking soda, and salt.

### Step 5

Add the dry ingredients to the wet and mix until just combined.

### Step 6

Use 1 Tablespoon measure of a .5 ounce cookie scoop to scoop the dough out onto your cookie sheet 2 inches apart.

### Step 7

Bake 10 minutes or until the edges of the cookies are set and the centers have puffed up but are still underdone.
Transfer the cookies to a wire rack. Allow the cookies to cool completely.

### Step 8

While the cookies cool, make the creme filling. Combine 1/2 cup unsalted butter, room temperature, 1/4 cup vegetable
shortening, 4 cups powdered sugar, 2 – 3 Tablespoons heavy cream, pinch of salt, and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract in a
stand mixer fit with the whisk attachment and beat on slow, gradually increasing to high until light and fluffy.
Transfer to a piping bag fit with a round tip.

### Step 9

Pipe the creme filling onto the backside of one of the cookies and sandwich together with another cookie.

### Step 10

Store in an airtight container or Ziploc bag for up to 7 days! Enjoy!
