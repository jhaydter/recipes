## Caramel Instructions

### Step 1

Combine [sweetened condensed milk][1], brown sugar, Treacle or golden syrup, unsalted butter, and salt in a small
saucepan and bring to a boil.

### Step 2

Simmer over medium heat until the sugar has completely dissolved and the mixture has thickened slightly.

### Step 3

Remove from the heat and place in the fridge to chill completely.

## Cookie Instructions

### Step 4

Combine the all-purpose flour and powdered sugar in a large bowl.

### Step 5

Add the chilled unsalted butter and rub it into the dry mixture with your fingers until it forms a sand-like texture.

### Step 6

Add the egg yolk and begin to knead the dough until it forms a shaggy dough.

### Step 7

Transfer the cookie dough to your work surface and continue to knead until it comes together to form a ball.

### Step 8

Place the dough between two sheets of parchment paper and roll it out to 1/4 inch / 6 mm in thickness.

### Step 9

Place the dough into the fridge to chill for a minimum of 1 hour.

### Step 10

Preheat the oven to 170°C/340°F, fan forced, and line an oven tray with parchment paper.

### Step 11

Once chilled remove the baking paper and cut out medium-sized rounds with a cookie cutter.

### Step 12

Place the cookies on the lined tray and bake for 15 minutes, or until lightly golden brown.

### Step 13

Remove and cool completely.

## Assembly Instructions

### Step 14

Transfer the caramel to a piping bag fitted with a small round tip.

### Step 15

Pipe a dollop of caramel on top of each cookie, leaving a 1 cm / 1/3 inch border around the edge of the cookie (this
gives the caramel some space to spread)

### Step 16

Melt the chocolate over a hot water bath or in the microwave until smooth

### Step 17

Place the cookies on a wire rack and pour the melted compound milk or semi-sweet chocolate over the cookies to coat

### Step 18

Carefully transfer the coated cookies onto an oven tray lined with baking paper and sprinkle with flaky salt

### Step 19

Leave the cookies at room temperature for 30 minutes to set.

### Step 20

Enjoy!
