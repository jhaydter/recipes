## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375Â°F. Line baking sheet with parchment paper. Place 1/4 cup
granulated sugar for rolling in small bowl.

### Step 2

Whisk all-purpose flour, cinnamon, ginger, baking soda, cloves, allspice, salt, and pepper in medium bowl until
thoroughly combined. Combine dark brown sugar and remaining 1/4 cup granulated sugar in second medium bowl. Add unsalted
butter and whisk until smooth. Add molasses, egg yolk, and vanilla and whisk until smooth. Add flour mixture and stir
with rubber spatula until completely incorporated.

### Step 3

Using tablespoon measure, scoop heaping tablespoon of dough and roll between your palms into 1.5 inch ball. Roll in
sugar to coat and place on prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough, spacing dough balls about 2 inches apart.
Bake until cookies are browned, still puffy, and edges have begun to set but centers are still soft (cookies will look
raw between cracks and seem underdone), 9 to 11 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking.

### Step 4

Let cookies cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes. Use wide metal spatula to transfer cookies to wire rack. Let cookies
cool completely before serving. (Cookies can be stored at room temperature in airtight container or zipper-lock plastic
bag for up to 5 days.)
