## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Microwave your all-purpose flour for in 15 second intervals, (30 seconds to 1 minute total) till it reaches an internal
temperature of 160°F, to eliminate any risk of e. coli or salmonella

!!! note

    If you are also worried about the raw flour, its an easy fix. Put the flour on a pan and bake for a few minutes at
    350°F until it reaches 160°F! Or microwave for about 30 seconds!

### Step 3

In a small bowl, cream together your unsalted butter and your granulated sugar and brown sugar until mixed.

### Step 4

Add in your vanilla and milk and stir to combine.

### Step 5

Add in your salt and flour and mix until all combined. (Add a little more flour if mixture is too wet)

### Step 6

Dump in your chocolate chips and stir them into the cookie dough.
