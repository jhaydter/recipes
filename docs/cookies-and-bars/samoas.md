### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 350°F.

### Step 2

In the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, cream the unsalted butter and granulated sugar until light and
fluffy.

### Step 3

In a separate bowl, stir together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt.

### Step 4

Add the flour mixture to the butter, in a few additions, and beat until combined. Stop to scrape the sides and the
bottom of the bowl a few times.

### Step 5

After that, add the milk and vanilla and mix to combine.

### Step 6

Remove the dough from the mixer and separate it into two equal halves. Press each half into a disk and wrap it in
plastic wrap. Chill in the fridge for about 1 hour.

### Step 7

Lightly flour a flat surface and once the dough has chilled, roll it out on the floured surface into a 1/8 inch thick
circle.

### Step 8

Using a doughnut cutter, cut out as many cookies as possible. Also, you can use a larger and a smaller glass, to cut the
cookies and also the hole in the center.

### Step 9

Arrange the cookies on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper 1 inch apart.

### Step 10

Bake for 10 to 15 minutes or until they are pale golden brown.

### Step 11

Transfer the cookies onto a wire rack to cool completely before adding the topping.

Once done, remove from the oven to cool.

### Step 15

Melt the caramels and milk in a double boiler over medium-low heat and stir until melted.

### Step 16

Remove from heat, and in a large bowl combine half of the melted caramel with the toasted coconut. Stir until fully
combined.

### Step 17

Spread the remaining caramel into a thin layer onto the cookies.

### Step 18

Next, using your hands, press the coconut mixture onto the caramel. Let the cookie cool.

### Step 19

Melt the dark chocolate in a double boiler and dip the bottom of the cookies into the chocolate and place them on a wax
paper-lined baking sheet.
