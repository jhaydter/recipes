## :pencil: Instructions - Macarons

### Step 1

Clean all utensils with vinegar to remove all oils.

### Step 2

Blitz the confectioners sugar and ground almonds in a food processor.

### Step 3

Pulse 16 times. Should look like bread crumbs.

### Step 4

Sift the confectioners' sugar and ground almonds into a large bowl.

### Step 5

Divide the egg whites into two equal portions (72 g each). Some people use aged egg whites.

### Step 6

Add one half of the egg whites to the almond and sugar mixture to make a paste. Can add food coloring paste (optional)
at this moment.

!!! note

    Liquid color can change the consistency of the paste.

### Step 7

Cover with plastic wrap.

### Step 8

Make an italian meringue by adding sugar syrup by adding cold water and granulated sugar to large heavy saucepan.

### Step 9

Bring sugar syrup to 230°F (110°C) on medium heat.

### Step 10

Add the second half of the room temperature egg whites into a very clean bowl.

### Step 11

Using an electric mixer, whisk egg whites. Once the sugar syrup reaches 245°F (118°C) and the egg whites begin to
foam, SLOWLY add the sugar syrup by pouring it along the wall of the bowl.

### Step 12

Continue to beat for 5 to 6 minutes until meringue is glossy and flops over nicely and the bowl comes to room
temperature.

### Step 13

Begin folding a small spoonful of the Italian meringue into the almond mixture. Can be quite vigorous and don't need to
be too gentle.

### Step 14

Be careful to add the remaining meringue and fold in gently.

### Step 15

The final mixture should look like flowing lava, and be able to fall into a figure eight without breaking. Spoon into a
piping bag with a medium round piping tip (around 1 cm in diameter) and you’re ready to start piping.

### Step 16

Pipe 1.5 inch dollops onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper (this should be glued down with dabs of batter).
Tap on counter several times to release air bubbles. Use a toothpick to pop any air bubbles and fill any gaps. Allow to
sit for about 40 minutes, so that a skin forms, before placing in oven. They should be dry when touched with a finger.

### Step 17

Bake at 325°F (165°C) for 12 to 15 minutes, rotate tray after 7 minutes. They are ready when you touch them and the
top comes away from the bottom. Allow to cool completely before removing from baking sheet, about 10 to 15 minutes.

### Step 18

Combine granulated sugar and water in medium saucepan. Heat over low heat while stirring until sugar dissolves.
Increase heat to medium- high and bring to a boil

### Step 19

Put egg yolks in a stand-mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and beat until thick and foamy.

### Step 20

Cook the sugar and water syrup until it reaches 240°F. Immediately remove from heat. With mixer running, SLOWLY drizzle
hot syrup into bowl with yolks.

### Step 21

Continue mixing until the bottom of the bowl is cool to the touch and the yolk mixture has cooled to room temperature.

### Step 22

Add in unsalted butter one cube at a time allowing each piece to incorporate before adding the next. Add vanilla and
salt. Continue mixing until buttercream is smooth and creamy. (About 5 to 6 minutes.) Add food coloring if desired.

### Step 23

After assembly, refrigerate overnight or for a full 24 hours so that the filling solidifies.
