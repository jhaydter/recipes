## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Melt 1 stick unsalted butter in a small saucepan or skillet over medium heat until it begins to foam and bubble.
Continue cooking, swirling the pan occasionally, until the cracking sounds stop, about 2 minutes. Continue to swirl the
pan or stir with a heatproof spatula until brown bits start to form at the bottom and the butter starts to smell nutty.
When the bits are amber in color and the butter is light brown, immediately remove from the heat. Scrape into a medium
heatproof bowl, making sure to scrape all the browned solids into the bowl. Add 1 teaspoon water and set aside to cool
slightly.

### Step 2

Meanwhile, place 1.25 cups all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon cornstarch, and 1 teaspoon baking powder in a second medium
bowl and whisk to combine.

### Step 3

Add 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, 2 tablespoons packed brown sugar, 1 large egg, 2 teaspoons vanilla
extract, and 1 teaspoon kosher salt to the browned butter. Whisk well to combine. Add 1/2 cup white chocolate chips and
1/2 cup roasted, salted macadamia nuts, and fold with a flexible spatula until combined.

### Step 4

Add 1/2 of the flour mixture and fold until the flour is mostly incorporated. Add the remaining flour mixture and fold
until just combined. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, arrange 2 racks to divide the oven into
thirds and heat the oven to 350ºF. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.

### Step 5

Scoop out the cookie dough into 20 (2 rounded tablespoon) portions and place on the baking sheets, spacing them evenly
apart. No need to roll into smooth balls — irregular cookie shapes make for dynamic cookies!

### Step 6

Bake until the cookies are lightly golden and puffed, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes,
then transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely.
