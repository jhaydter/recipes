## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 325Â°F.

### Step 2

In a large bowl, whisk together orange juice, honey, lemon juice, lemon zest, vanilla, and cognac or rum. Gradually
drizzle in olive oil, whisking to combine.

### Step 3

In a separate bowl, combine baking soda, baking powder, all-purpose flour, cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg.

### Step 4

Slowly add dry ingredient mixture to wet ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not over mix or knead, as the
dough will become tough.

### Step 5

Let rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.

### Step 6

Roll dough into walnut-size balls (30 g) and score with a fork. Place balls on a baking sheet, about an inch apart from each
other.

### Step 7

Bake for 14 to 18 minutes, or until golden.

### Step 8

Drizzle with honey, if desired.
