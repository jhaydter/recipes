## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

With a rolling pin, crush the [shortbread cookies][3] in a freezer bag. Put the crushed cookies into a bowl with the
melted butter. Mix them together, then using a spoon, press the mixture into the base of a lined, square cake pan.
Chill in the fridge for 10 minutes.

### Step 2

Gently heat the dark brown sugar and 2/3 cup of butter in a non-stick pan, stirring until melted.

### Step 3

Add the [sweetened condensed milk][2], cinnamon, and vanilla, and bring to a boil, stirring continuously until the
mixture has thickened slightly — on a high heat for about 5 minutes.

### Step 4

Pour the caramel over the base, then allow it to cool for at least 20 minutes. Once cooled, chill in the fridge or
freeze until set — around 1 hour.

### Step 5

Melt the dark chocolate and white chocolate in separate bowls. Put them in the microwave for 30-second bursts on high
and keep stirring until melted.

### Step 6

Pour the dark chocolate over the caramel, then add spoonfuls of the melted white chocolate on top.

### Step 7

Using a spoon, swirl them together until you get a marbled effect. Put the pan back in the fridge to set for another 30
minutes.

### Step 8

When set, slice into squares and serve.
