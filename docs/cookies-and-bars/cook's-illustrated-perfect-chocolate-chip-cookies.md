## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 375°F. Line 2 large 18x12-in baking sheets with parchment paper.

### Step 2

In a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour and baking soda; set aside.

### Step 3

Heat 10 tablespoons of the unsalted butter in a 10-inch stainless steel or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat
until melted, about 2 minutes. Continue cooking, swirling the pan constantly until the butter is dark golden brown and
has a nutty aroma, 1 to 3 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and transfer the browned butter to a large heatproof bowl.
Stir the remaining 4 tablespoons butter into the hot browned butter until completely melted. Set aside and let cool to
room temperature.

### Step 4

Add granulated sugar, dark brown sugar, salt, and vanilla to the bowl with the butter and whisk until fully
incorporated. Add the egg and egg yolk and whisk until the mixture is smooth with no sugar lumps remaining, about 30
seconds. Let the mixture stand for 3 minutes, then whisk for 30 seconds. Repeat the process of resting and whisking 2
more times until the mixture is thick, smooth, and shiny. Using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, stir in the flour
mixture until just combined, about 1 minute. Stir in the semi-sweet chocolate chips and give the dough a final stir to
ensure there are no hidden flour pockets.

### Step 5

Press plastic wrap against the dough and refrigerate for at least 24 hours, up to 72 hours.

### Step 6

Scoop the dough into 16 even portions, each about 3 tablespoons (60 g), and arrange them 2 inches apart on the prepared baking
sheets, 8 dough balls per sheet.

### Step 7

Bake the cookies 1 tray at a time until the cookies are golden brown but still puffy, and the edges have begun to set
but centers are still soft, 10 to 14 minutes, rotating the baking sheet halfway through baking. Transfer the baking
sheet to wire rack and allow cookies to cool completely before serving. Cookies can be stored in an airtight container
at room temperature for up to 3 days.
