## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 350°F (150°C). For this recipe, I did fan as there will be multiple trays in the oven and you will
want them to bake evenly.

### Step 2

In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter and confectioners' sugar until light and fluffy and there are no
lumps.

### Step 3

Slowly add in the egg whites and mix until smooth. Add the remaining whole egg and mix until fully incorporated. If the
mix curdles don't worry, just give it a good whisk to bring it back together.

### Step 4

Once combined, add the all-purpose flour, vanilla, and salt and mix until it just comes together. Do not overmix.

### Step 5

The batter will be somewhat soft. Place batter in a piping bag fitted with a medium pastry tip. Pipe it in even mounds
onto a cookie sheet (roughly 2 teaspoons). Keep cookies about 1.5 inches apart as the batter will spread when baked.

### Step 6

Place in oven and bake for approximately 18 to 20 minutes or until golden.

### Step 7

Once cooled store in an airtight for up to 7 days. Use for a cookie crust or for a classic banana pudding.
