## :pencil: Instructions - Day 1: Make Batter

### Step 1

In a medium pot, melt the unsalted butter, brown sugar, and honey over low heat. Stir gently with a heatproof spatula to
ensure nothing burns. Keep the mixture warm over very low heat, or reheat if necessary.

### Step 2

In a large bowl, combine the granulated sugar, salt, all-purpose flour, and baking powder and mix well with a whisk.
Form a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the eggs one by one, whisking to incorporate each before adding
the next.

!!! tip

    Use room temperature eggs to avoid cooling down the batter. If the batter is too cold, the butter may congeal when
    you add it.

### Step 3

When the eggs are fully incorporated and the batter is smooth, slowly whisk in the butter mixture. Whisk in the lemon
and orange zests. The batter will still be runny and similar in consistency to cake batter. Cover with plastic wrap
pressed directly onto the surface of the batter, to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate overnight to rest.

!!! tip

    Many recipes containing baking powder do well to rest overnight. This helps with rising, which is especially
    important for the madeleine - a pastry that puffs up in the center when it bakes.

## :pencil: Instructions - Day 2: Pipe, Bake, and Serve

### Step 4

Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C) for conventional or 350°F (175°C) for
convection.

!!! tip

    In general for baking pastries, set your oven to convection if the option is available. This allows the heat to
    flow more evenly. It’s an ideal setting because it helps pastries bake evenly on all sides.

### Step 5

Using a rubber spatula, place 2 large scoops of batter in a piping bag so that it is one-third full. Push the batter
down toward the tip of the bag.

### Step 6

Cut an opening about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) straight across the tip of the bag.

### Step 7

Hold the nonstick cooking spray about 4 inches (10 cm) away from a nonstick mini madeleine pan and spray evenly in all
the cavities.

### Step 8

Holding the piping bag at a 90° angle about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) above the pan, pipe the madeleine batter into the
cavities so that it fills each about three-quarters of the way to the top.

### Step 9

Place a rimmed sheet pan upside down on the oven rack then place the mold on top and bake the madeleines for about 2 to
2.5 minutes on the center rack.

### Step 10

When you see the batter puff up in the center, rotate the mold 180°. Bake for 2 to 2.5 minutes more, until the sides of
the madeleines are golden blonde and the center has set.

!!! tip

    Baking the madeleines on an upside down sheet pan lifts the mold off the oven rack, so that the more intense heat
    in the bars of the rack does not transfer to the cakes in an uneven fashion. This also allows the heat of the oven to
    circulate around the mold more evenly, thus baking the madeleines more efficiently.

### Step 11

Unmold immediately. Bang the corner or sides of the madeleine pan against your work surface so that the fresh madeleines
drop out.

!!! tip

    If you find that the madeleines stick to the mold, for the next batch, try spraying a bit more cooking spray.
    Keeping the mold clean and washing it thoroughly with a soft sponge after use will also prevent the madeleines from
    sticking.

### Step 12

Using a small sieve, sprinkle confectioners’ sugar evenly over the fresh-baked madeleines. Eat immediately (do not
wait for more than even a few minutes!).

### Step 13

Madeleines are good only when freshly baked. Do not attempt to store them. However, you can keep the batter in a closed
airtight container, with plastic wrap pressed onto the surface, in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
