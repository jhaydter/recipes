## :salt: Ingredients

- :maple_leaf: 1.75 cups light brown sugar
- :egg: 2 large eggs
- :icecream: 0.5 tsp vanilla

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 rimmed sheet pan
- 1 parchment paper
- 1 medium bowl
- 1 spatula

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Line a rimmed sheet pan with parchment paper.

### Step 2

In a medium bowl, vigorously whisk together the light brown sugar and eggs until incorporated. Whisk in the vanilla
extract. Add the creamy peanut butter and mix with a spatula until smooth and completely incorporated, and until no
ribbons of peanut butter can be seen. You know the dough is ready when it has the consistency of Play-Doh.

### Step 3

Using a scoop or a spoon, form the dough into 12 approximately 2 inch (2 to 2.25 ounce) balls and place them on the
prepared rimmed sheet pan. For smaller cookies, use a heaping tablespoon.

### Step 4

Sprinkle the dough balls lightly with coarse-grained sea salt just before baking. Bake for 20 to 22 minutes, turning the
rimmed sheet pan once halfway through baking (for smaller cookies, bake for 16 to 18 minutes). When finished, the
cookies will be lightly golden and cracked on top. Let cool completely before serving.

### Step 5

You can bake these cookies as soon as the dough is prepared, but they will retain their shape better if you freeze them
for 15 minutes before baking.
