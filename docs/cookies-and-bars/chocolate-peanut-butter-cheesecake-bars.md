## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.

### Step 2

In a mixing bowl, cream the butter, 1 cup sugar, and the brown sugar until they're light and fluffy. Mix in 2 of the
eggs.

### Step 3

In a separate bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, cocoa powder, and salt. Gradually mix the
dry ingredients into the wet ingredients to form a soft dough.

### Step 4

Press the dough into a greased 9x13-inch pan. Bake for 10 minutes, then remove it from the oven and set it aside as you
make the topping.

### Step 5

In a mixing bowl, add the cream cheese, 1/2 cup [peanut butter][1], and 1/2 cup sugar. Whip the mixture to combine,
then mix in the remaining 2 eggs. Mix until smooth.

### Step 6

Pour the topping over the prepared base and return the pan to the oven. Bake for another 20 minutes, until slightly
jiggly.

### Step 7

Remove the bars from the oven and set aside to cool.

### Step 8

Top the bars with chopped Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and Reese's Pieces. Melt the remaining 1 tablespoon of peanut
butter. Drizzle the top of the bars with the melted peanut butter.

### Step 9

Allow the bars to fully cool and set for 1 hour before cutting and serving.
