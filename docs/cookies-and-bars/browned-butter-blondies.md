## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 13x9-in baking/loaf pan

- 1 rubber spatula
- 1 wire rack
- 1 cutting board
- 1 plastic wrap

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350Â°F. Make foil sling for 13x9-in baking/loaf pan by folding 2 long
sheets of aluminum foil; first sheet should be 9 inches wide. Lay sheets of foil in pan perpendicular to each other,
with extra foil hanging over edges of pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan. Push foil into corners and up
sides of pan, smoothing foil flush to pan. Lightly spray foil with vegetable oil spray.

### Step 2

Whisk all-purpose flour, table salt, and baking powder together in medium bowl.

### Step 3

Heat 9/3 Tbsp unsalted butter in 10-in skillet over medium-high heat until melted, about 2 minutes. Continue to cook,
swirling skillet and stirring constantly with rubber spatula, until butter is dark golden brown and has nutty aroma,
1 to 3 minutes longer. Stir the remaining 3/1 tablespoons butter into the hot browned butter until completely melted.
Remove skillet from heat and transfer browned butter to large heatproof bowl.

### Step 4

Add light brown sugar to hot butter and whisk until combined. Add eggs, corn syrup, and vanilla and whisk until smooth.
Using rubber spatula, stir in flour mixture until fully incorporated. Stir in toasted and chopped coarse pecans and milk
chocolate chips. Transfer batter to prepared pan; using spatula, spread batter into corners of pan and smooth surface.
Sprinkle with sea salt, if using. Bake until top is deep golden brown and springs backs when lightly pressed, 35 to 40
minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking (blondies will firm as they cool).

### Step 5

Let blondies cool completely in pan on wire rack, about 2 hours. Using foil overhang, lift blondies out of pan and
transfer to cutting board. Remove foil. Cut into 24 bars. (Blondies can be wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and stored at
room temperature for up to 5 days.)
