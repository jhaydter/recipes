## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200Â°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil, shiny side up.

### Step 2

In a large bowl, combine the egg whites, cream of tartar, and salt. Beat until soft peaks form, then gradually add the
granulated sugar, continuing to beat until the mixture is stiff and glossy. Add the vanilla at the end.

### Step 3

Drop the meringue by large spoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheet and sprinkle each meringue with a bit of sugar. Bake
for 1.5 hours. Turn off the heat and leave the meringues in the oven until they're completely cool, 3 hours or more.
These are good to make in the evening; they can be left in the oven, with the heat turned off, overnight. Store them in
an airtight container to keep them crisp.
