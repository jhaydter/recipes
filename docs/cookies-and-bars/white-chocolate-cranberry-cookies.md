## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.

### Step 2

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a large mixing bowl using an electric mixer, mix
the unsalted butter, light brown sugar, and granulated sugar together for 1 to 2 minutes or until well combined. Mix in
the eggs one at a time, then mix in the vanilla extract.

### Step 3

Slowly add in the dry ingredients and continue mixing until just combined, making sure to scrape down the sides of the
bowl as needed. Then mix in the white chocolate chips and dried cranberries until thoroughly combined.

### Step 4

Cover the cookie dough tightly and transfer to the refrigerator to chill for at least 2 hours.

### Step 5

Once the dough is almost chilled, preheat the oven to 350째F (180째C). Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or
silicone baking mats and set aside.

### Step 6

Remove the cookie dough from the refrigerator. Using a 1.5 tablespoon cookie scoop, scoop the cookie dough and drop onto
the prepared baking sheets. Make sure to leave a little room between each ball of cookie dough as they will spread a
little while they bake.

### Step 7

Bake in separate batches at 350째F (180째C) for 10 to 12 minutes or until the edges of the cookies are lightly browned
and the top is set. Remove from the oven and cool on the baking sheet for 5 to 10 minutes, then transfer the cookies to
a wire rack to cool completely.
