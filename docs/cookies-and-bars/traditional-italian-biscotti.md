## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 375°F.

### Step 2

Lightly grease one or two baking sheets, or line them with parchment.

### Step 3

In a large bowl, beat together the unsalted butter, vegetable shortening, and granulated sugar, then add the eggs one at
a time, beating well after each addition and scraping down the bowl midway through. Beat in the vanilla, aniseed, lemon
extract, baking powder, and salt. Mix in the all-purpose flour 1 cup at a time to make a cohesive, well-mixed dough. Add
the almonds or hazelnuts, mixing until they're distributed throughout the dough.

### Step 4

Transfer the dough to a lightly floured or lightly greased work surface. Divide it into three fairly equal pieces and
shape each piece into a rough 12 inch log. Transfer each log to the prepared baking sheet, leaving about 3 inches
between them; you may need to use two baking sheets. Wet your fingers and pat the logs into smooth-topped rectangles 12
inches long x 2.5 inches wide and 7/8 inches thick.

### Step 5

Bake the logs for 20 to 25 minutes, until they're beginning to brown around the edges. Remove them from the oven and let
rest for 20 minutes. Lower the oven temperature to 300°F.

### Step 6

Gently transfer the logs to a cutting surface and use a serrated knife to cut them on the diagonal into 1/2 inch wide
slices. Because of the nuts and the nature of the dough, the biscotti at this point are prone to crumbling; just be sure
to use a slow, gentle sawing motion and accept the fact that some bits and pieces will break off. Carefully transfer the
slices, cut sides up, to a parchment-lined or ungreased baking sheet. You can crowd them together, as they won't expand;
about 1/4 inch breathing space is all that's required.

### Step 7

Return the biscotti to the oven and bake them for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven, quickly turn them over, and bake for
an additional 20 minutes, or until they're very dry and beginning to brown. Remove them from the oven, cool completely,
and store in an airtight container.
