## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

In a 300Â°F oven, toast blanched and peeled almonds for 10 minutes.

### Step 2

In a food processor or high-powered blender, process almonds until they reach the consistency of coarse almond flour. In
a sauce pot, combine 1/2 cup sugar and orange flower water. Heat over very low heat until the syrup becomes thick. Add
the almond flour into the syrup, mixing to combine over heat for a couple minutes.

### Step 3

Turn off heat and add lemon zest, mixing to combine.

### Step 4

When cool enough to handle, roll dough into walnut-size balls with hands.

### Step 5

Roll the balls in remaining sugar.

### Step 6

Let almond balls dry completely and wrap in tissue paper, twirling the sides like candy wrappers.

### Step 7

Keep in glass jars or another covered container.
