### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 350°F.

### Step 2

Place the unsalted butter, confectioners' sugar and vanilla in a large bowl, and beat with an electric mixer until
combined, light, and fluffy.

### Step 3

Add the all-purpose flour and salt and mix until it’s crumbly and looks like it can’t be mixed more.

### Step 4

Add the whole milk and keep mixing. The dough should clump together after about 15 seconds.

### Step 5

Place the dough into a pastry bag fitted with a very large star tip, and pipe onto a silicone mat lined baking sheet,
with no more than 12 cookies per sheet.

### Step 6

Bake the cookies for 15 minutes or until lightly golden.

### Step 7

Let them cool completely (on the tray is fine), and enjoy!
