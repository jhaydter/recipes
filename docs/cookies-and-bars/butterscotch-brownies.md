## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C), and line a 9 x 3-inch baking pan with parchment paper.

### Step 2

Sift the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Set aside.

### Step 3

In a separate bowl, beat the unsalted butter, brown sugar, and vanilla with an electric mixer until light and fluffy
(about 5 minutes). Add the eggs, one by one, beating well after every addition.

### Step 4

Change to a wooden spoon or spatula, then gradually pour the flour into the butter and egg mixture. Stir until only a
few streaks of flour remain.

### Step 5

Add 1 cup of butterscotch morsels and the chopped nuts (optional), then gently mix to combine.

### Step 6

Spoon and spread the mixture into the lined baking pan. Sprinkle remaining butterscotch morsels on top.

### Step 7

Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the edges start to pull away from the sides. Let the brownies cool for about 15
minutes, or until cool enough to touch. Slice, serve, and enjoy!
