## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Biscuit (bis-KWEE) is a classic air-leavened sponge cake used to make fancy layered cakes. This light, dry-textured cake
is meant to be soaked with syrups before being filled with buttercream, mousse, or other filling. This recipe yields two
1-inch layers or one 2-inch layer that can be sliced into 2 or 3 thin layers.

### Step 2

Have all ingredients at room temperature, about 70°F. Preheat the oven to 325°F. Grease and flour the bottom(s) of two
9 x 2-inch round cake pans or one 10-inch springform pan or line the bottom(s) with wax or parchment paper. Measure and
return to the sifter sifted cake flour

### Step 3

Beat in a large bowl on high speed until thick and pale yellow, 2 to 3 minutes 6 large egg yolks, 1/4 cup sugar, and 1
teaspoon vanilla

### Step 4

Sift the flour evenly over the top but do not mix it in. Using clean beaters, beat in another large bowl on medium speed
until soft peaks form 6 large egg whites and 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar

### Step 5

Gradually add, beating on high speed 1/3 cup sugar.

### Step 6

Beat until the peaks are stiff but not dry. Use a rubber or silicone spatula to fold one-third of the egg whites not
quite thoroughly into the egg yolk mixture. Fold in the remaining whites in 2 additions. Scrape the batter into the
pan(s) and spread evenly.

### Step 7

Bake until the top springs back when lightly pressed and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25
minutes in cake pans, 35 to 40 minutes in a springform pan. To cool and remove from the pan.
