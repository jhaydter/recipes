## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Julienne the carrots and the daikon radishes: Cut them first crosswise into 2.5 inch long segments. Then cut 1/4 inch
thick slices lengthwise. Stack the slices and cut them again into 1/4 inch thick batons.

### Step 2

Massage in the salt and sugar: Place the carrots and daikon radishes in a large bowl. Sprinkle with 4 teaspoons of
granulated sugar and 2 teaspoons of salt. Use your clean hands to toss the carrots and daikon with the salt and sugar
until well coated.

### Step 3

Continue to mix the carrots and daikon with your hands until they begin to soften, about 3 minutes. They are ready once
you can bend a piece of daikon all the way over without it breaking.

### Step 4

Rinse: Transfer the carrots and daikon to a colander, rinse with cool water and drain well.

### Step 5

Make the vinegar and sugar mixture: In a bowl (an 8 cup Pyrex measuring cup works great for this) mix together one cup
of granulated sugar, the white vinegar and the warm water, until the sugar dissolves.

### Step 6

Pack the vegetables in the jars and fill with the vinegar mixture: Prepare clean jars. Pack the daikon and carrots
tightly into the jars. Pour over the pickling liquid to cover. Seal. Refrigerate.

### Step 7

The pickles should sit at least overnight before eating; their flavor will improve with time. They should last 4 to 6
weeks in the refrigerator.
