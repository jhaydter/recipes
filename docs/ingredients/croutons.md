| 4-6 cups | 20 minutes |

## :salt: Ingredients

- :olive: 0.25 cup olive oil
- :baguette_bread: 1 loaf bread
- :herb: 2 tsp [Italian seasoning][1]
- :garlic: 1 tsp garlic powder
- :salt: 0.75 tsp salt

- 1 parchment paper
- 1 large bowl

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper; set aside.

### Step 2

In a large bowl, evenly drizzle the olive oil over the bread chunks. Then evenly sprinkle the Italian seasoning, garlic
powder, salt and pepper over the bread. Toss gently until well-combined.

### Step 3

Spread the bread cubes out in a single layer on a baking sheet.

### Step 4

Bake until golden, turning once halfway through cooking in order to brown all sides of the croutons.  Cooking time will
depend on the thickness of the cubes, so watch to be sure that they do not burn. (Mine generally take between 15 to 20
minutes.)

### Step 5

Remove from oven, and let cool completely. Use immediately, or store in an air-tight container for up to 1 week.
