## :salt: Ingredients

- :chestnut: 10 raw, unsalted almonds
- :tumbler_glass: 2 oz vodka or bourbon

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 2-fl. oz glass jar

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

To skin the almonds you first blanch them. This means plunging them into boiling water for one minute exactly. Wash
under cold running water until they are quite cold, then squeeze the nut out of the skin, or rub it off in a clean tea
cloth.

### Step 2

Chop your raw, unsalted almonds small enough to fit in your 2-fl. oz glass jar.

### Step 3

Place chopped almonds into your jar.

!!! note

    For the almond extract, it is probably best to use, or re-use, a larger jar. Then as few as 8 almonds, which have
    been skinned, chopped and covered with the vodka or bourbon or glycerin in a small jar if using. I would use a
    larger jar and a handful of almonds, as many as you like. Cover the chopped almonds to about one inch over the
    ingredients and proceed. Then, when it is ready, you can strain it into smaller bottles and proceed to use the same
    almonds for a second batch.
