| 22 minutes |

## :salt: Ingredients

- :peanuts: 4 cups raw or preroasted peanuts

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 rimmed baking sheet

## :pencil: Instructions

!!! note

    You can use raw or preroasted peanuts here, but do not use salted peanuts. Roasting the nuts before grinding them not
    only boosts their flavor but also warms their oils, allowing for faster breakdown during processing. (We also warm
    preroasted nuts for this reason.)

### Step 1

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375Â°F. Spread raw or preroasted peanuts in single layer on rimmed
baking sheet and roast until fragrant and slightly darkened, 10 to 12 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through roasting.
(If using preroasted peanuts, place in oven for 5 minutes to warm.) Transfer sheet to wire rack and let peanuts cool
slightly, about 10 minutes.
