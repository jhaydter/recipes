## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

In a small bowl, combine granulated sugar and apple [pectin][2]. Pour the [strawberry purée][1] into a medium pot and
bring to a simmer over medium heat. Stir in the lemon juice and rum.

### Step 2

While whisking, sprinkle the sugar and pectin mixture on top of the simmering purée and mix until incorporated.

!!! tip

    Make sure to sprinkle the sugar and pectin mixture evenly over the purée, rather than dumping the whole mixture in
    at once as it may clump into a ball.

### Step 3

Continue cooking the purée for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally until the purée has reduced to a thick jam
texture.

!!! tip

    To test for when the jam is set, spoon some onto a marble surface or plate, let cool for 1 minute, then run your
    finger through it to see if the jam stays put and doesn’t run back together. If it stays put, then it’s ready!

### Step 4

Remove the pot from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Transfer the jam to a bowl. Chill in the fridge, covered
with plastic wrap, until ready to use.
