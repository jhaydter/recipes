## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 425°F.

### Step 2

Slice your tofu into your desired shape. I usually go with quarter-sized squares - I'd recommend sticking close to that
size and ensure that you slice it no thicker than ½ inch.

### Step 3

Add the tofu to your mixing bowl and add the olive oil, sriracha, and soy sauce. Gently mix to combine.

### Step 4

Spread evenly on a cookie sheet and bake for 10 minutes.

### Step 5

After 10 minutes, remove your baking sheet from the oven and flip each piece of tofu. Drizzle the remaining marinade
over the tofu and bake for another 10 to 12 minutes.

### Step 6

One the tofu is crispy on the outside, remove from the oven.
