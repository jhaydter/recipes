## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 425째F (218째C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

### Step 2

Wrap your extra-firm tofu in an absorbent towel. Set something heavy on top - like a cast iron skillet - to press out
extra moisture for 15 minutes. Alternatively, use a tofu press.

### Step 3

Crumble the tofu into pieces less than 1/2-inch in size and arrange them on the parchment-lined baking sheet.

### Step 4

In a small bowl, whisk the remaining ingredients (tamari, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, tomato paste, garlic, basil,
oregano, thyme, and salt). Pour over the tofu and toss to coat.

### Step 5

Bake for 20 minutes, flip with a spatula, and bake for another 10 to 15 minutes or until the tofu is a little firm and
golden with crispy edges.

### Step 6

Enjoy warm or at room temperature. This tofu is the perfect protein boost for wraps, risotto, polenta, creamy pink
pasta, pasta arrabiata, or on pizza or paired with roasted vegetables.

### Step 7

Leftovers keep in a sealed container in the refrigerator for 3-4 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month. Reheat in a
skillet or in the oven at 350째F (176째C) for 5-10 minutes until warm and crispy.
