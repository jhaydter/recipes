## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

### Step 2

If your block of extra-firm tofu is larger than 12 ounces, trim it down. Then drain your tofu and use a tofu press or
wrap in an absorbent towel several times and place something heavy on top to press for 15 to 20 minutes.

### Step 3

Once pressed, slice tofu into roughly 1/2-inch cubes and arrange on the parchment-lined baking sheet in a single layer.
Ensure they aren't touching so they will crisp up. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes to dry/firm the tofu.

!!! note

    At 20 minutes, the tofu should be chewy, and at 25 minutes, the tofu should be more crispy. Bake according to
    preference.

### Step 4

In the meantime, prepare sauce by adding peanut butter, sesame oil, tamari or soy sauce or coconut aminos, maple syrup,
and chili garlic sauce to a medium mixing bowl and whisking until combined. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding
more chili garlic sauce for heat, maple syrup for sweetness, or tamari for saltiness.

### Step 5

Add baked tofu to the peanut sauce and toss to coat. Let marinate for 10 to 15 minutes to saturate the tofu and infuse
the flavor.

### Step 6

In the meantime, prepare cauliflower rice by using a large grater or the grater attachment on a food processor. Set
aside. Mince garlic if you haven’t already done so, and wash and slice any veggies (optional) you want to add to the
dish (optional).

### Step 7

Heat a large rimmed skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add sesame oil (1 Tbsp as original recipe is written // adjust
if altering serving size), cauliflower rice, garlic, and tamari. Stir and sauté, stirring occasionally, for about 5 to
8 minutes until slightly browned and tender. Transfer to a serving platter.

### Step 8

If adding any veggies to your dish (optional), cook them now in a bit of sesame oil and a dash of tamari until just
tender. Add to the cauliflower rice.

### Step 9

To the preheated pan, add the marinated tofu with most of the sauce (reserving a few spoonfuls for serving). Cook,
stirring frequently for about 3 minutes until browned. The sauce will caramelize and may stick to the pan a bit – this
is normal and adds more flavor to the dish. Stir with spatula, scraping up any caramelized bits. Then transfer tofu to
the cauliflower rice platter.

### Step 10

Serve with any leftover sauce. Leftovers reheat well and will keep covered in the refrigerator up to 2-3 days. Not
freezer friendly.
