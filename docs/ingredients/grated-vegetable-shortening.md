| 45 minutes |

## :salt: Ingredients

- :carrot: 1 stick vegetable shortening

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 box grater
- 1 cold bowl or onto a cold plate

## :pencil: Instructions

!!! note
    [Substitute][1] for suet.

### Step 1

If you can't find suet then we have found that grated vegetable shortening (such as Trex, Crisco or Copha) is a good
substitute. To grate the shortening firstly freeze a stick or block of it until firm but not solid (this usually takes
about 30 minutes).

### Step 2

Grate the shortening on the coarse side of a box grater into a cold bowl or onto a cold plate, returning the fat to the
freezer if it becomes too soft.

### Step 3

Before using the grated shortening chill it for another 10 to 15 minutes in the freezer.
