## :salt: Ingredients

- :droplet: 8 cup water
- :orange_circle: 3 large naval oranges
- :candy: 2.5 cup granulated sugar
- :salt: 0.5 tsp kosher salt

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 colander
- 1 medium saucepan
- 1 vegetable peeler or paring knife
- 1 saucepan

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Place a colander in the sink. Bring 2 cups of the water to a boil in a medium saucepan over high heat.

### Step 2

Meanwhile, trim the top and bottom ends of 3 large naval oranges. Use a vegetable peeler or paring knife to peel 1 inch
wide strips of zest from the oranges, going from top to bottom and making sure the strips have a thin layer of white
pith (this will prevent the strips from curling too much later). Use a knife to cut the zest strips lengthwise into
thinner 1/4 inch strips. Add the strips to the saucepan (itâ€™s okay if the water isn't not boiling yet).

### Step 3

Once the water is boiling, boil the orange peels for 30 seconds. Drain in the colander. Return the peels to the saucepan
and add 2 cups of the water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Boil for 30 seconds and drain again. Repeat one more time
for a total of 3 blanches.

### Step 4

Return the peels to the saucepan. Add the remaining 2 cups water, 1 1/2 cups of the granulated sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon
kosher salt. Stir to combine and bring to a simmer over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium low and simmer until the
peels are translucent and the syrup is thickened, 20 to 25 minutes. Meanwhile, line a baking sheet with parchment paper
and place a wire rack on top.

### Step 5

Turn off the heat. Let the peels rest in the syrup for 5 minutes. Use tongs or chopsticks to transfer the peels onto the
rack in a single layer, making sure they do not touch. Let dry on the rack for at least 6 hours to dehydrate and
complete the candying process.

### Step 6

Place the remaining 1 cup granulated sugar in a shallow bowl. Working with a few at a time, toss the candied orange
peels in the sugar until evenly coated all over.
