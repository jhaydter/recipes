- :icecream: 448 g heavy cream

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 bowl of ice water

- 1 spatula
- 1 hand blender
- 1 stand mixer
- 1 large rubber spatula
- 1 plastic wrap

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Soak the gelatin sheets in a bowl of ice water until soft, about 20 minutes. (If using powdered gelatin, sprinkle 2 tsp
(6g) gelatin over 6 tsp (30g) water in a small bowl, stir, and let sit for 20 minutes to bloom.)

!!! tip

    Whether using sheet or powdered gelatin, you must use cold water since warm or hot water will immediately dissolve
    the gelatin and you will not be able to work with it.

### Step 2

In a small pot, bring the whole milk to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally with a whisk. Remove from heat.

### Step 3

Place the 70 percent dark chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl. Pour half of the hot milk over the chocolate and let it
stand for 30 seconds. Stir gently with a spatula until the milk has melted the chocolate. Once melted, pour in the
remaining milk, and stir to combine.

### Step 4

Switch to a hand blender and emulsify the ganache until smooth, glossy, and free of any lumps.

### Step 5

Squeeze out any excess water from your bloomed gelatin sheets. Whisk the bloomed gelatin into the hot ganache until the
gelatin has dissolved. When finished, the ganache should have the consistency of mayonnaise. Let cool to 90 to 95°F (32
to 35°C).

### Step 6

In a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the heavy cream until it forms medium-stiff peaks.

!!! tip

    At room temperature, the ganache will remain smooth but won’t melt the whipped cream.

### Step 7

Using a large rubber spatula, slowly pour the ganache into the whipped cream as you constantly fold until fully
incorporated. Be careful not to overmix, so as not to deflate the airy texture of the mousse.

### Step 8

Cover the mousse with plastic wrap pressed directly on the surface, to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate for at
least 12 hours to set.

!!! info "Variation"

    To make a silky hazelnut dark chocolate mousse, start with the dark chocolate mousse recipe, and add in 100 g
    (1/3 cup) store-bought hazelnut paste as you warm up your milk. You can purchase hazelnut paste online.
