### Step 1

In a Dutch oven at very low heat, cook the onions covered (no oil, no water nothing) just the onions for about 60 to 90
minutes. When cooked drain and set aside.

### Step 2

After the onions have drained all the water, in a sauté pan, heat the olive oil and sweet butter at a medium heat, add
the drained onion and cook until light golden brown.

### Step 3

Add the light brown sugar and the balsamic vinegar. Cook for at least 10 minutes at very low heat. Season with salt and
pepper. The onions are supposed to be NOT sweet NOT sour.

!!! tip

    Spread the hot onions on a large flat surface, such as a sheet pan and let all of the water evaporate before
    putting in the freezer to prevent the formation of ice crystals.
