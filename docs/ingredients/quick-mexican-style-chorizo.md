### Step 1

Combine vegetable oil, ancho chile powder, paprika, ground coriander, dried oregano, salt, pepper, ground cinnamon,
cayenne, and allspice in 12-inch nonstick skillet. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture is bubbling
and fragrant. Off heat, carefully stir in cider vinegar, sugar, and garlic (mixture will sputter). Let stand until steam
subsides and skillet cools slightly, about 5 minutes.

### Step 2

Add soy meat to skillet. Mash and mix with rubber spatula until spice mixture is evenly incorporated into soy meat.
Return skillet to medium-high heat and cook, mashing and stirring until soy meat has broken into fine crumbles and
juices are bubbling, about 3 minutes.
