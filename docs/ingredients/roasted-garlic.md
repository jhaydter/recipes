| 40 minutes |

## :salt: Ingredients

- :garlic: 1 whole garlic bulb
- :olive: some olive oil

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 baking pan

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat your oven to 400째F (205째 C). A toaster oven works great for this.

### Step 2

Peel and discard the papery outer layers of the whole garlic bulb. Leave intact the skins of the individual cloves of
garlic

### Step 3

Using a sharp knife, cut 1/4 to a 1/2 inch from the top of cloves. This exposes the individual cloves of garlic.

### Step 4

Place the garlic heads in a baking pan, cut side up. (A muffin pan works great for this, as it keeps the garlic bulbs
from rolling around.)

### Step 5

Drizzle a couple teaspoons of olive oil over each exposed head, using your fingers to rub the olive oil over all the
cut, exposed garlic cloves.

### Step 6

Cover the bulb with aluminum foil.

### Step 7

Bake at 400째F (205째C) for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the cloves are lightly browned and feel soft when pressed.

### Step 8

Allow the garlic to cool enough so you can touch it without burning yourself. Use a small knife cut the skin slightly
around each clove. Use a cocktail fork or your fingers to pull or squeeze the roasted garlic cloves out of their skins.

### Step 9

Eat as is (I love straight roasted garlic) or mash with a fork and use for cooking. Can be spread over warm French
bread, mixed with sour cream for a topping for baked potatoes, or mixed in with Parmesan and pasta.
