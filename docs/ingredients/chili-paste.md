## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Peel and quarter the onion, and peel the garlic.

### Step 2

Place fresh chillies, garlic, onion, cashews candlenuts (alternative), macadamia (alternative), granulated sugar, and
salt in a blender. Add enough water to allow you to blend to a paste.

### Step 3

As you'll be frying the paste in oil, you don't want it to be too runny.

### Step 4

However, the long and slow cooking means that you may have to add a splash of water towards the end if it gets too dry.

### Step 5

Heat the vegetable oil in a deep wok or saucepan, then fry the chili paste on medium heat initially for about 3 minutes
until fragrant.

### Step 6

Lower the heat and cook for 1 hour, uncovered, stirring every 15 minutes or so. In the last 15 minutes, you might have
to stir a couple of times more, as the chili paste starts to dry up.

### Step 7

If it starts getting too dry and is catching (burning) at the bottom, add a splash of water (about 60 ml / 1/4 cup) to
allow you to keep cooking the paste for the full hour. Use less if you only have 10 minutes or so to go.

### Step 8

Let your cooked red chili paste cool to room temperature and store in a clean jar in the fridge; it will last up to 2
weeks in the fridge. You can even freeze until needed, in ice cube trays would be perfect, as you can use a little at a
time as needed.
