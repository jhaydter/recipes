| :timer_clock: Total Time |
|:-----------------------: |
| 26 minutes |

## :salt: Ingredients

- :glass_of_milk: 4 cup [whole milk][1]
- :glass_of_milk: 2 cup heavy cream
- :salt: 1 tsp salt
- :sake: 3 Tbsp white wine vinegar

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 large sieve
- 1 deep bowl
- 1 cheesecloth
- 1 stainless-steel or enameled pot
- 1 bowl

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Set a large sieve over a deep bowl. Dampen 2 layers of cheesecloth with water and line the sieve with the cheesecloth.

### Step 2

Pour the whole milk and heavy cream into a stainless-steel or enameled pot such as Le Creuset. Stir in the salt. Bring
to a full boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Turn off the heat and stir in the white wine vinegar. Allow the
mixture to stand for 1 minute until it curdles. It will separate into thick parts (the curds) and milky parts (the
whey).

### Step 3

Pour the mixture into the cheesecloth-lined sieve and allow it to drain into the bowl at room temperature for 20 to 25
minutes, occasionally discarding the liquid that collects in the bowl. The longer you let the mixture drain, the thicker
the ricotta. (I tend to like mine on the thicker side, but some prefer it moister.) Transfer the ricotta to a bowl,
discarding the cheesecloth and any remaining whey. Use immediately or cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. The
ricotta will keep refrigerated for 4 to 5 days.
