### Step 2

Store in an airtight container. Use to season meats, chicken, fish, salads, vegetables, soups, and stews.

!!! note

    Certain herbs are known to pair well with particular foods: rosemary with lamb, tarragon with chicken, basil with
    tomatoes, and fennel with fish so it is best to keep these combinations in mind when mixing your herbs. You might
    want to try making separate batches, each with different ratios of herbs for use in various recipes. Just be sure
    to label your containers.
