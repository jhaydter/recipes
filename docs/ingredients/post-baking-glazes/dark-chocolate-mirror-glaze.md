!!! tip

    Make this the day before you’re ready to glaze your cake, as the glaze needs to set in the fridge first before
    using.

### Step 1

In a medium pot, bring granulated sugar and heavy cream to a boil over medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves.

### Step 2

In a small bowl, dissolve the gelatin, powdered in 60 g (1/4 cup) of cold water.

### Step 3

In a bowl, combine the 148 g (2/3 cups) room temperature water with the unsweetened cocoa powder, stirring with a
spatula until it becomes a uniform paste.

### Step 4

Stir the bloomed gelatin into the cream-sugar mixture until dissolved, then stir in the cocoa powder paste until
combined. Remove the pot from the heat, and pour the glaze mixture through a mesh strainer over a heatproof bowl to
remove any clumps of undissolved cocoa powder. Emulsify the mixture with a hand blender to remove any lumps, until
smooth.

### Step 5

Cover and chill in the fridge overnight to set, until ready to use.

### Step 6

When you’re ready to glaze your cake, remove the glaze from the fridge and heat in the microwave until it’s exactly
86 to 95°F (30 to 35°C), so it’s liquid and pourable and will give your cake a shiny, uniform finish. If it looks
like it’s slightly separated, use a hand blender to blitz it together. Make sure to tap the container a bit so that
the bubbles from blending go away.
