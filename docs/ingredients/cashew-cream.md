# :chestnut: Cashew Cream

![Cashew Cream][1]{ loading=lazy }

| :fork_and_knife_with_plate: Serves | :timer_clock: Total Time |
|:----------------------------------:|:-----------------------: |
| 12 | 31 minutes |

## :salt: Ingredients

!!! tip

    Use the lesser amount for the texture of light coconut milk and the greater amount to resemble full-fat coconut
    milk

- :chestnut: 0.5 to 1 cup cashews
- :droplet: 1 cup water

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 heatproof bowl
- 1 high-speed blender

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Add cashews to a heatproof bowl and cover with hot water by at least 1-2 inches. Soak for 20 to 30 minutes.

### Step 2

Drain the cashews and add them to a high-speed blender with 1 cup (240 ml) fresh water. Blend on high until completely
smooth - about 1 minute.

### Step 3

Store leftover cashew cream in a sealed container in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days. We haven’t tested freezing it,
but suspect it would work, though it’s always best when fresh.

!!! tip

    Use in place of coconut milk or dairy cream in pasta, soup, overnight oats, beverages (only if using the lesser
    amount of cashews - and strain for best texture), desserts, and anything else that would benefit from a creamy
    boost! Sadly, it doesn’t work for making whipped cream.
