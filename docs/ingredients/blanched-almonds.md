| :timer_clock: Total Time |

| 1 minutes |

## :salt: Ingredients

- :chestnut: some almonds
- :hotsprings: some boiling water

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 heat-safe bowl

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Put the almonds in a heat-safe bowl and pour boiling water on top to cover. Let stand for 1 minutes (don't let them soak
too long in the hot water or the nuts themselves will soften too much).

### Step 2

Drain the almonds and run cold water over them to cool them down.

### Step 3

The soaked almonds should now have skins that are loose enough to remove. Working one almond at a time, gently squeeze
the nut between your fingers to begin popping it out of the skin, then peel the skin away to remove it fully.
