## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Bring to a boil in a small saucepan 3/4 cup heavy cream.

### Step 2

Remove from the heat and add finely chopped semisweet or bittersweet chocolate.

### Step 3

Stir until most of the chocolate is melted. Cover and let stand for 10 minutes, then stir or whisk very gently until
completely smooth. Stir in liqueur (optional).

### Step 4

For a pourable glaze, let stand at room temperature, stirring occasionally, until the ganache cools to about 85°F. For
frosting, let stand until spreadable. If the ganache becomes too stiff, set the pan in a larger pan of hot water and
stir until softened; or remelt and cool to 85°F to 95°F for use as a glaze.

### Step 5

This keeps for up to 3 days at room temperature or up to 1 week refrigerated.
