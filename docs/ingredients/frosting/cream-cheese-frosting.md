!!! info

    There are two secrets to making perfectly smooth cream cheese frosting with enough body to swirl on a cake or
    pipe through a pastry bag: Do not overbeat, and use cold - not softened - cream cheese. Have the butter, if
    using it, at room temperature, and sift the confectioners' sugar after measuring.

!!! info

    Feel free to vary the amount of confectioners' sugar to suit your taste: we have seen recipes with as little
    as 1 tsp and as much as 1/2 cup sugar per once of cream cheese.
