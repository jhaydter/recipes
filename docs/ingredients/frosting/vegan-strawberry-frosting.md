## :salt: Ingredients

- :strawberry: 0.5 cup fresh strawberries (80 g)
- :butter: 0.33 cup vegan butter
- :candy: 4 cup confectioners' sugar

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 large mixing bowl
- 1 electric hand mixer

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Make strawberry purée by blending fresh strawberries (80 g) until smooth.

### Step 2

Add softened vegan butter to a large mixing bowl and use an electric hand mixer to beat until fluffy — about 1 minute.

### Step 3

Add 1/4 cup strawberry purée and beat again until fully incorporated, scraping down the sides as needed.

### Step 4

Begin adding sifted confectioners' sugar 1/4 cup (28 g) at a time (sifting reduces clumps). Mix on low speed until each
1/4 cup is well incorporated and thick yet spreadable. We found that 3.5 cups (392 g) was the sweet spot (literally)!

### Step 5

Spread frosting on a fully cooled strawberry, vanilla, or chocolate cake and enjoy! Use immediately or store frosting in
the refrigerator up to 5 days or in the freezer up to 1 month.
