!!! note

    Stir in chopped peanuts to taste, or sprinkle them over the finished cake, if desired. Try this as a filling for
    any cake frosted or glazed with chocolate. Have the cream cheese cold. The butter can be cold, but it's better to
    have it at room temperature.

### Step 1

Beat in a medium bowl just until blended [smooth peanut butter][1], cold cream cheese, unsalted butter, softened,
vanilla, cream or milk, and bourbon or rum (optional).

### Step 2

Add one-third at a time and beat just until smooth and the desired consistency is reached confectioners' sugar, sifted.

### Step 3

If the frosting is too stiff, add, but do not overbeat cream, milk, or liquor or as needed.
