## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Add egg yolks to a stand mixer and whisk on high until nice and pale and fluffy. Consistency should be super thick and
glossy and shiny.

### Step 2

Make sugar syrup by adding granulated sugar and cold water to a large heavy saucepan and give the pan a swirl so that
that are no bits of sugar around the edge of the pan and turn on medium-high heat.

### Step 3

Use a candy thermometer to monitor the temperature until it gets to 237°F (114°C).

### Step 4

Set the mixer to high-medium speed and pour in the sugar syrup on the inside wall of the bowl in a small steady stream,
being careful not to have the syrup make contact with the whisk.

### Step 5

Set mixer to highest speed.

### Step 6

Whip for 5 minutes until the mixture is nice and cool. This is referred to as a pâte à bombe.

### Step 7

Mix soft unsalted butter a little bit at a time to the mixer while on slow speed. Turn up speed until incorporated.
Repeat until all butter has been used.

!!! note

    Salt and vanilla may be added later to add flavor.
