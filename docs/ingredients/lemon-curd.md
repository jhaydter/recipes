## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Using a carrot peeler, remove the zest of 3 lemons, being careful to avoid the white pith. Put the zest in a food
processor fitted with the steel blade. Add the sugar and pulse until the zest is very finely minced into the sugar.

### Step 2

Cream the room temperature butter and beat in the sugar and lemon mixture. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, and then add the
lemon juice and salt. Mix until combined.

### Step 3

Pour the mixture into a 2 quart saucepan, double boiler, or bain-marie and cook over low heat until thickened (about 10
minutes), stirring constantly. The lemon curd will thicken at about 170Â°F, or just below simmer. Remove from the heat
and pass through a fine mesh sieve and cool or refrigerate.

!!! tip

    It is best to sieve the mixture while it is still hot.
