## :pencil: Instructions

!!! note
    You can use raw or preroasted peanuts here, but do not use salted peanuts. Roasting the nuts before grinding them not
    only boosts their flavor but also warms their oils, allowing for faster breakdown during processing. (We also warm
    preroasted nuts for this reason.) You can customize your peanut butter by adding 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon,
    nutmeg, or ginger or 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne pepper to the peanuts before processing in step 2.

### Step 1

[Dry roast the raw or preroasted peanuts][1].

### Step 2

Process peanuts in food processor until oil is released and paste begins to form, scraping down sides of bowl often. Add
honey and salt and continue to process to desired smoothness, 3 to 4 minutes longer. Season with extra honey and salt to
taste. If butter is thicker than desired, thin by adding vegetable oil, 1 teaspoon at a time, pulsing 3 times after each
addition, until desired consistency is reached. If butter is thinner than desired, thicken by adding water, 1 teaspoon
at a time, pulsing 3 times after each addition, until desired consistency is reached. Transfer to jar with tight-fitting
lid. Butter can be stored at room temperature or refrigerated for up to 2 months.
