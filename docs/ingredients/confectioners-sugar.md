### Step 1

In order to make your own confectioners' sugar, you will need a fairly high-powered blender or a spice grinder. You
should also add one tablespoon of cornstarch to each cup of granulated sugar. Blend both ingredients on high for 30
seconds, and guess what? You now have powdered sugar.

!!! note

    Do not try this in a food processor, since this appliance will not be able to grind the sugar finely enough to
    turn it into a powder.
