## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

A bouquet garni is a combination of herbs, vegetables, and occasionally spices bundled in cheesecloth or tied with a
string and used to flavor soup, stock, and sauces. They are removed before serving.

### Step 2

Fresh Herbs: Bunch together parsley, bay leaf, thyme, leek, white portion only (optional), and cloves.

### Step 3

To make removal easier, you may place them inside several overlapping celery ribs or leak greens and bind tightly with
kitchen string.

### Step 4

Dried Herbs: If you cannot get fresh herbs, wrap dried herbs, coarsely crumbled but not powdered, in 4-inch squares of
cheesecloth tied into pouches. Store in tightly covered container up to 1 month.

### Step 5

Allow for 12 bags dried parsley, dried thyme,dried marjoram, bay leaves, and dried celery leaves.
