## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 325°F with a rack in the bottom third. Have on hand an ungreased 10" tube or angel food cake pan.

### Step 2

In a large mixing bowl, beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar until foamy. Gradually add 1/2 cup (99g) of the
granulated sugar and continue beating until stiff and glossy. Set aside.

### Step 3

In a medium bowl, whisk together the remaining 1 cup (198g) sugar with the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt.

### Step 4

In a large mixing bowl or bowl of your stand mixer, use the whisk attachment to beat the vegetable oil, reserved egg
yolks, and vanilla and almond extract until pale yellow. Add the dry ingredients in thirds, alternating with the whole
milk, beating at medium speed for 2 to 4 minutes.

### Step 5

Gently fold in the whipped egg whites with a whisk or spatula just until the batter is uniform. Scrape the bottom of the
bowl to ensure the batter is evenly mixed.

### Step 6

Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 50 minutes without opening the oven; the cake will rise high above the
pan then settle back almost even as it continues to bake.

### Step 7

Increase the oven temperature to 350°F and bake for 10 minutes more, until a gentle touch on the center of the cake
leaves no indent; if you listen carefully, the cake should make a crackling sound.

### Step 8

Remove from the oven and invert the tube pan over the neck of a wine bottle for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, use a
thin-bladed flexible spatula to free the cake from the sides and tube of the pan. Turn the cake out onto a serving plate
to finish cooling completely.

!!! note

    If using a 12 x 8.5 sheet pan, bake for 20 to 30 minutes at 360°F.
