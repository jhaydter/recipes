## :salt: Ingredients

- :egg: 4 eggs

- :icecream: 0.33 tsp vanilla
- :salt: 0.25 tsp salt
- :ear_of_rice: 120 g cake flour

- 1 parchment paper
- 1 large heat-proof bowl
- 1 hand mixer

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line the bottom and sides of the cake pan with parchment paper.

### Step 2

In a large heat-proof bowl, add the eggs, granulated sugar, vanilla, and salt. Place the bowl inside a larger bowl
filled with hot water (bain-marie). Using a hand mixer, beat the eggs on high speed until soft, fluffy, and pale yellow
ribbons form, about 8 to 10 minutes. Replace the hot water halfway through as it cools down.

### Step 3

Reduce to the lowest speed and mix for 3 minutes to pop large air bubbles.

### Step 4

Sift in the cake flour in three parts, gently folding after each time.

### Step 5

To help incorporate the butter, mix 3 heaping spoonfuls of the batter into the warmed, melted butter. Next, gently fold
the butter mixture into the batter.

### Step 6

Pour the batter into your cake pan and bake at 350°F until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. For one
9-inch round pan, about 25 minutes. For two 6-inch round pans, about 18 minutes.

### Step 7

Remove all parchment paper and allow it to cool completely on a cooling rack. Slice into even layers
using a leveler and top with fresh fruit and fill with cream. Enjoy! See Note 3 for the sugar syrup option.
