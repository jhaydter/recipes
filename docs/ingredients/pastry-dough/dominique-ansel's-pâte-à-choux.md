## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 375°F.

### Step 2

Combine the water, whole milk, unsalted butter, sugar and salt in a medium pot over medium heat and bring to a boil.

### Step 3

Add the all-purpose flour and stir, using a wooden spoon, until the mixture comes together, about 5 minutes. Continue to
stir until the dough begins to dry out and pull away from the sides of the pot, about 2 minutes.

### Step 4

Transfer the dough to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Whip on low speed, adding the 3 eggs
one at a time, making sure each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next.

### Step 5

Cut the tip of a piping bag and insert a plain round tip. Using a rubber spatula, transfer the choux to the piping bag.
Line a sheet tray with parchment paper and pipe 5 rows of choux dough, 5 in each row, about 1.5 inches in diameter,
leaving a 1 inch gap between rounds. Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the egg wash on each choux. Bake on a center
rack at 375° for 10 minutes. Rotate the sheet tray and bake for an additional 10 minutes until the mounds are puffed
and golden brown.

### Step 6

Remove the sheet tray from the pan and allow to cool for a few minutes before serving.

!!! note

    For cheese puffs, add 2 ounces (about 1/2 cup) grated Comté or Gruyère cheese after all of the eggs have been
    incorporated in step 3.
