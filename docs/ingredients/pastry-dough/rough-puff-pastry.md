## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Mix the all-purpose flour and salt together in a bowl. Rub in the chilled butter using your fingertips until the mixture
resembles breadcrumbs. Gradually add enough water to form a dough (about 4-6 tablespoons of water).

### Step 2

Roll the dough out into a rectangle on a lightly floured work surface.

### Step 3

Grate half of the frozen butter over the bottom two thirds of the dough. Fold down the top third and fold up the bottom
third as if folding a letter.

### Step 4

Turn the folded dough through 90 degrees and roll it out into a rectangle again. Repeat the process of adding the
remaining frozen butter and fold as before.

### Step 5

Wrap the dough in cling film and leave to rest in the fridge for 30 minutes before using.
