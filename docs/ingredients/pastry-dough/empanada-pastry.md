## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Mix the all-purpose flour and salt in a food processor.

### Step 2

Add the butter and pulse.

### Step 3

Add the egg and the water or milk (in small increments) and continue pulsing until a clumpy dough forms.

### Step 4

To make the empanada dough by hand, follow the same instruction but use your hands to mix the ingredients together.

### Step 5

Split the dough into 2 large ball, flatten slightly into the shape of disks. The dough can be used immediately or
refrigerated until ready to use (1-2 days max).

### Step 6

Roll out the dough into a thin sheet and cut out round disc shapes for empanadas (use round molds or a small plate). You
can also make small individual balls with the dough and roll out each individual ball to a round shape (doesn’t need
to be perfectly round) – if you have a tortilla press you can use it to flatten the dough balls.

### Step 7

Use immediately, or store in the refrigerator/freezer to use later.
