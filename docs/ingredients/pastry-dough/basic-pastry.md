## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

For a 9-in single-crust pie, use half the recipe.

### Step 2

Stir together all-purpose flour and salt.

### Step 3

Add chilled vegetable shortening and cold unsalted butter.

### Step 4

Cut half of the shortening into the flour mixture with a pastry blender or work it in lightly with the tips of your
fingers until it has the consistency of cornmeal. Cut the remaining half into the dough until it is pea-sized. Sprinkle
the dough with ice water.

### Step 5

Blend the water gently into the dough until it just holds together; you may lift the ingredients with a fork, allowing
the moisture to spread. If necessary to hold the ingredients together, add 1 tsp to 1 Tbsp ice water.

### Step 6

Divide the dough in half, shape each into a disk, and wrap in plastic wrap. To fill the bake, see individual recipes.
