## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 425°F.

### Step 2

Put the water, unsalted butter, and salt in a saucepan on low heat until the butter melts. Once melted, bring the
mixture to a rolling boil.

### Step 3

Remove it from the heat and add the flour all at once. Stir vigorously.

### Step 4

Return the pan to the burner and cook over medium heat, stirring all the while, until the mixture forms a ball; this
should take only about a minute. A film should form on the bottom of the pan.

### Step 5

Remove the pan from the heat and spread on the inside of the mixer bowl to let the mixture cool for 5 to 10 minutes, to
140°F. It will still feel hot, but you should be able to hold a finger in it for a few seconds.

### Step 6

In the mixer, beat in the room temperature eggs one at a time; the mixture will become fluffy and glossy. Check that
the mixture is then enough by making a V when dripped from the mixer paddle. The mixture should be thick enough that
when a finger is dragged through it to make a trough, the sides of the trough continue to stand. Beat for at least 2
minutes after adding the last egg.

### Step 7

Form the choux paste into whatever shape you desire, using a spoon, or by putting the dough in a pastry bag and piping
it.

### Step 8

Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 375°F and bake for an additional 15 minutes. Turn off the
oven, open the door a crack, and leave the pastry inside to cool for 30 minutes. Remove from the oven to cool
completely. Carefully split the pastry, fill, and frost as desired.

  Sugar is optional. At the very least, choux should be seasoned with salt. If it's going to be used for a dessert, a
  small amount of sugar can also be added to gently push it in a sweet direction.
