## :salt: Ingredients

- :glass_of_milk: 3.25 cups full-fat milk

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 non-stick heavy bottom saucepan

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

In a non-stick heavy bottom saucepan, bring the full-fat milk to a simmer over medium heat (the milk will cook onto the
sides of the pan, so using a non-stick pan will be so much easier to clean).

### Step 2

Once it simmers, turn down the heat to medium-low and let it gently simmer, stirring the milk occasionally to make sure
it's not getting scorched on the bottom of the pan.

### Step 3

Simmer the milk for about 25 minutes or until it's reduced down to roughly 1 1/2-1 1/4 cups of liquid.

### Step 4

Once the milk has reduced and turned a creamy color pass it through a sieve remove any skin. Set aside to cool
completely.

### Step 5

Store the evaporated milk covered in the fridge for up to 5 days.
