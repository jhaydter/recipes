## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Place 2.5 cups whole milk, 1 cup granulated sugar, 1/2 cup heavy cream, and 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt in a medium
saucepan. Heat over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until bubbles form along the edges of the pan, about 5 minutes.
Do not let the mixture come to a boil.

### Step 2

Simmer, reducing the heat as needed and stirring and scraping the sides of the pan often, until thickened and reduced to
1.5 cups, 50 to 60 minutes. It should coat the back of a spoon.

### Step 3

Pour into a heatproof airtight container and let cool completely. Cover and refrigerate for up to 1 week or freeze for
up to 3 months. Let thaw overnight in the fridge and shake or whisk well before using.
