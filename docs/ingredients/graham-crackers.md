## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

In a food processor, combine cinnamon, baking soda, salt, baking powder, all-purpose flour, [dark brown sugar][1], and
graham flour. Pulse to combine. Add very cold diced unsalted butter and pulse until it resembles coarse cornmeal.

### Step 2

Add molasses, milk and vanilla. Pulse until a smooth dough forms. Press dough into a 1/2" thick disc, wrap in plastic
and refrigerate 30 minutes.

### Step 3

Roll dough between sheets of parchment to 1/8" thickness. Cut into 2 X 2 inch squares with a pizza cutter (or an
accordion cutter, if you have one). Prick each cracker 3 times with the tines of a fork (or a docking roller if you have
one). Remove irregular edges and bake in preheated 350Â°F oven for 25 minutes until the color has gotten slightly paler.
Allow to cool completely IN THE PAN. Store in zip top bag with as much air removed as possible for up to 14 days.
