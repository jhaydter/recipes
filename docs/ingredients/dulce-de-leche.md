| :timer_clock: Total Time |
|:-----------------------: |
| 3.00 hours |

## :salt: Ingredients

- :glass_of_milk: 1 can sweetened condensed milk

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 large pan
- 1 pair of tongs or slotted spoon

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Bring a large pan of water to a rolling boil. Make sure that you put enough water in the pan to completely cover the can
you're about to cook.

### Step 2

Remove the label from the can of sweetened condensed milk and carefully submerge it into the boiling water using a pair
of tongs or slotted spoon. Make sure you place the can on its side, so it can roll around. If you place the can bottom
or top-side down, the boiling water can cause it to bounce up and down, which is really annoying...

### Step 3

Cook the can for 3 hours, making sure the can is covered with water at all times. Add more boiling water if necessary.

### Step 4

Using a pair of tongs, a fork, or a slotted spoon, take the can out of the pan and place it onto a heatproof surface to
cool. Make sure it has cooled to room temperature before you open the can, otherwise the dulce de leche will squirt out
like a fountain... Once cooled, stir until smooth.

### Step 5

Cooled dulce de leche can be stored, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks

### Step 6

Spread it on bread, drizzle over cookies, cake or ice cream or eat by the spoonful. Enjoy!
