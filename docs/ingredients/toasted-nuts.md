- :chestnut: some nuts

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 sheet pan

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

For large batches of nuts, spread them on a sheet pan in a single layer and toast them in a 400°F oven for about 10
minutes. Shake the pan occasionally during this time to make sure the nuts toast evenly. The nuts are done when their
color has deepened and you can smell their aroma.

### Step 2

For smaller batches, you can toast them in a dry (un-oiled) pan over medium heat. Shake the pan constantly to prevent
burning, and the nuts are toasted when they’re evenly brown and have an aroma.

!!! note

    It’s best to toast only as many nuts as you’ll be using immediately. The intense toasted flavor diminishes
    with time.
