## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Mash the garbanzo beans in a large bowl. Stir in the onion, garlic, cilantro, parsley, cumin, turmeric, baking powder,
bread crumbs, salt and pepper. Do not be afraid to use your hands. Shape the mixture into 1-1/2 inch balls; you
should get 18 to 24. If the mixture does not hold together, add a little water.

### Step 2

Heat the oil in a deep fryer to 375°F (190°C). Carefully drop the balls into the hot oil, and fry until brown. If you
do not have a deep fryer, heat the oil in a heavy deep skillet over medium-high heat. You may need to adjust the heat
slightly after the first couple of falafels, and be sure to turn frequently so they brown evenly.
