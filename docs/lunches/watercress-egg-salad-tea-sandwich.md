## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Hard-boil the eggs, rinsing them in cold water when they are done.

### Step 2

While still warm, peel and mash eggs with unsalted butter, using a potato masher or fork.

### Step 3

Stir mayonnaise, salt, pepper, and paprika into egg mixture.

### Step 4

Spread egg salad onto 4 slices of the white bread.

### Step 5

Add watercress and parsley (optional), if using.

### Step 6

Top watercress with remaining 4 slices of bread.

### Step 7

Remove crusts and slice sandwiches twice, diagonally, to make 4 tea sandwiches from each large sandwich.

!!! note

    If you don't like or can't find watercress, baby arugula (alternative) would work well in this recipe, too, or
    even baby spinach if you'd like something with a little less of a peppery bite.

!!! note

    White bread is classic for tea sandwiches and especially for this watercress egg salad sandwich, but a soft, sweet
    wheat bread would work, too.
