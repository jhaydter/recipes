## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Pour 2 to 3 inches of vegetable oil in a large pot or dutch oven and heat to 350˚F over medium heat.

### Step 2

Pat dry with paper towels. Insert sticks into vegetarian hot dogs.

### Step 3

Whisk together corn meal, all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, baking powder and salt. Whisk together buttermilk, egg, 1
Tbsp vegetable or olive oil and honey. Combine wet and dry ingredients and whisk to combine.

### Step 4

Pour batter into a drinking glass almost to the top and dip hot dogs. Put corndog straight down into batter and give it
a little twirl to fully coat the hot dogs then swirl as you lift up. Let excess drip off.

### Step 5

Hold corn dog at an angle in the hot oil for 5 to 7 seconds to let it seal then drop into oil (this keeps them from
sticking to the bottom of the pot).

### Step 6

Fry 3 minutes or until golden brown. Fry up to 2 to 3 at a time (so you don’t drop the temperature), turning them as
needed to brown evenly. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.
