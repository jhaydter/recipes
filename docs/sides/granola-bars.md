## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Heat your oven to 350°F.

### Step 2

Remove and throw away the stones from the soft dates, then put the dates in a small saucepan with the honey. Bring to
the boil then blitz in your blender until you have a smooth paste. Leave to cool a little while you get the rest of your
ingredients ready.

### Step 3

Roughly chop the pecans with a large knife, then chop the dried apricots.

### Step 4

Put the rolled oats, pecans, apricots, sunflower seeds, unsweetened desiccated coconut and chia seeds into a mixing bowl
and add the date paste. Mix everything together really well.

### Step 5

Line a brownie tin (approximately 23cm square) with baking paper and brush it with a little tasteless oil like vegetable
oil. Pour the granola mixture on top, pressing it into the corners and making sure it is roughly flat on top.

### Step 6

Put the tray into the oven for 40 minutes until lightly brown on top, then remove the tray from the oven and leave to
cool completely.

### Step 7

Cut into bars and try not to eat them all or you won’t have any left for your breakfast!
