## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Rinse, peel and chop the apples. While chopping, make sure to remove the seeds and pith from the center of the apples.

### Step 2

Place them in a sauce pan or pan.

### Step 3

Add 1/2 to 2/3 cups of water. The water should just about cover the apples.

### Step 4

Bring this mixture to a simmer on a low to medium heat. You can add granulated sugar (optional) if you prefer.

### Step 5

If the apples are very sweet, then you don't need to add sugar. If they are less sweet or not sweet, then add sugar as
needed.

### Step 6

Add lemon juice.

### Step 7

You can also add spices like cinnamon (optional) or nutmeg (optional) or vanilla extract at this step.

### Step 8

Simmer till the apples are softened. Keep stirring occasionally when the apples are getting cooked.

### Step 9

If the water dries out and the apples start sticking to the pan, then add more water.

### Step 10

Once the mixture becomes warm, you can either mash the apples or puree them in a blender or immersion blender.

### Step 11

Mashing gives a slight chunky texture. Blending them will give a smooth texture.

### Step 12

The final color of the applesauce depends on the variety of apples used.

### Step 13

Pour applesauce in bottles or bowls. Once cooled refrigerate them for about a week or freeze for 1 to 2 months.
