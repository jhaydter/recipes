## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 400Â°F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or spray with cooking spray; set aside.

### Step 2

Harissa Yogurt: Combine Greek yogurt and harissa in a small bowl, cover and refrigerate.

### Step 3

Falafel Scones: In a large bowl, combine TJ's falafel mix, flour, sugar, and baking powder in a large bowl. Cut the
unsalted butter into the dry ingredients until crumbly, leaving pea sized chunks of butter. Set aside.

### Step 4

In a medium bowl, lightly beat the large eggs and heavy cream. Make a well in the center of dry mixture and add egg
mixture. Fold gently with a spatula, until just combined. Gently stir in sun-dried tomatoes, if using.

### Step 5

Divide dough in half. Stretch dough into a circle, about 6 inches in diameter and 1/2 inch thick, and place it on the
prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough. Cut each circle into six triangles, and top with sliced red bell
pepper, if using.

### Step 6

Place baking sheet on center rack of oven and bake 15 to 17 minutes until golden. Remove from oven and transfer scones
to a wire rack to cool. Wait 5 minutes, then serve with harissa yogurt for drizzling.
