| :timer_clock: Total Time |
|:-----------------------: |
| 1.22 hours |

## :salt: Ingredients

- 2 Tbsp kosher salt
- 0.5 tsp baking soda
- 4 lbs Yukon gold potatoes
- 5 Tbsp olive oil
- 1 small handful rosemary
- 3 cloves garlic
- some black pepper
- 1 small handful parsley

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 large pot

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 450°F (230°C) (or 400°F (200°C) if using convection). Heat 2
quarts (2L) water in a large pot over high heat until boiling. Add 2 tablespoons kosher salt (about 1 ounce; 25g),
baking soda, and Yukon gold potatoes and stir. Return to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until a knife meets little
resistance when inserted into a potato chunk, about 10 minutes after returning to a boil.

### Step 2

Meanwhile, combine olive oil, duck fat, or beef fat with finely chopped rosemary, garlic, and a few grinds of black
pepper in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat. Cook, stirring and shaking pan constantly, until garlic just
begins to turn golden, about 3 minutes. Immediately strain oil through a fine-mesh strainer set in a large bowl. Set
garlic/rosemary mixture aside and reserve separately.

### Step 3

When potatoes are cooked, drain carefully and let them rest in the pot for about 30 seconds to allow excess moisture to
evaporate. Transfer to bowl with infused oil, season to taste with a little more salt and pepper, and toss to coat,
shaking bowl roughly, until a thick layer of mashed potato–like paste has built up on the potato chunks.

### Step 4

Transfer potatoes to a large rimmed baking sheet and separate them, spreading them out evenly. Transfer to oven and
roast, without moving, for 20 minutes. Using a thin, flexible metal spatula to release any stuck potatoes, shake pan and
turn potatoes. Continue roasting until potatoes are deep brown and crisp all over, turning and shaking them a few times
during cooking, 30 to 40 minutes longer.

### Step 5

Transfer potatoes to a large bowl and add garlic/rosemary mixture and minced parsley. Toss to coat and season with more
salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.
