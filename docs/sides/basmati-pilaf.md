### Step 1

Preheat the oven to fan 160°C / conventional 180°C (350°F) / gas 4. You will need a medium casserole with a lid.
Rinse the rice well in a large bowl of water, then drain.

### Step 2

Melt two-thirds of the unsalted butter in the casserole and sauté the onion for about 5 minutes. Add the basmati rice,
stir well, then add the thyme, bay leaves, cinnamon sticks, cardamom pods, cloves, and lemon zest and cook for 1 minute.
Now pour in the boiling vegetable stock or water and mix into the rice, along with sea salt and ground black pepper to
taste.

### Step 3

Cover and bake for 25 minutes. Leave to stand for 5 minutes, then remove the lid and fork through the remaining butter
until the rice is fluffy and separated.
