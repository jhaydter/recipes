## :salt: Ingredients

- 16 oz edamame
- 3 quarts salted water
- 0.5 tsp arrowroot starch
- 1 Tbsp coconut oil
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 Tbsp ginger

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Cook the edamame according to package instructions — microwaving (covered), steaming, or boiling all work equally
well. We boiled our edamame in 3 quarts of salted water for 8 minutes} drained, and set aside.

### Step 2

While the edamame cooks, combine the water and arrowroot starch in a small mixing bowl or measuring cup. Whisk until the
starch is dissolved. Set aside.

### Step 3

Next, melt the coconut oil in a large rimmed stainless steel or non-stick skillet over medium-low heat. Once melted, add
the garlic, ginger, and red pepper flakes. Sauté for 1 to 2 minutes until fragrant and lightly sizzling, but be careful
not to let the garlic burn or it can become bitter.

### Step 4

Add the tamari and maple syrup and stir to evenly combine, then add the arrowroot/water slurry. Bring this mixture to a
boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes until sauce is thick and sticky.

### Step 5

Remove from heat, add the edamame, and stir to combine with sauce. Finish with the toasted sesame oil (optional), toss,
and enjoy! Delicious alongside stir-fries, fried rice, or noodles!

### Step 6

Best when fresh, but it will keep for 2-3 days in the refrigerator. Reheat in a microwave or covered and steamed in a
skillet. Not freezer friendly.
