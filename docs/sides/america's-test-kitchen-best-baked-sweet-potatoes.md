## :salt: Ingredients

- 4 sweet potatoes

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 large plate
- 1 microwave

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Prick your sweet potatoes a few times with a fork, place them on a large plate, and then microwave them until they reach
an internal temperature of 200°F. That should take between 6 and 9 minutes, but remember temperature is more important
than time! Flip the spuds every 3 minutes, and start checking them for doneness around the 6-minute mark.

### Step 2

Once nuked, transfer the sweet potato to a 425°F oven for 1 hour.
