## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Place the small white potatoes and 2 tablespoons of salt in a large pot of water. Bring the water to a boil, then lower
the heat and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, until the potatoes are just slightly tender when pierced with a knife.

### Step 2

Drain the potatoes into a colander. Set the colander over the empty pot and cover it with a clean kitchen towel. Allow
the potatoes to steam for another 15 to 20 minutes, until theyâ€™re tender but not mushy.

### Step 3

Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, buttermilk, Dijon mustard, whole-grain mustard, dill, 1
teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of pepper. Set aside.

### Step 4

When the potatoes are cool enough to handle but still warm, cut them into bite-size chunks. Place the cut-up potatoes in
a large bowl and immediately pour the dressing over them. Add the celery and red onion, 2 teaspoons of salt and 1
teaspoon of pepper. Toss until the dressing coats every bite. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for a few hours to allow
the flavors to blend. Serve cold or at room temperature.
