- :salt: 0.25 tsp salt

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Aromatics: Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and shallots, sauté 3 minutes until soft, but don't
let them go golden.

### Step 2

Cook peas: Add frozen peas and vegetable broth, increase heat to bring to simmer then cover and reduce heat to medium.
Simmer 2 minutes.

### Step 3

Reserve Liquid: Remove 1/3 cup liquid from the saucepan, reserve.

### Step 4

Blitz: Transfer all peas and remaining liquid into a food processor. Add salt and white pepper, and mint (optional) if
using. Blitz on high for 1 minute until smooth.

### Step 5

Optional straining: For extra smooth, press through a mesh colander (optional) with a rubber spatula (optional) (it's
easy).

### Step 6

Adjust consistency: Use Reserved Liquid as needed to achieve the desired consistency – I like a soft, dolloping
consistency. Sometimes people want it looser. Add more salt and pepper if desired – remember, this is not supposed to
be strongly flavored or seasoned!

### Step 7

Serve warm. Either dollop/smear onto plates, or serve in bowls for people to help themselves.
