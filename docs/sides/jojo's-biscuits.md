## :salt: Ingredients

- :ear_of_rice: 4 cups (480 g) self-rising flour
- :dash: 2 Tbsp baking powder
- :cup_with_straw: 1 tsp baking soda
- :butter: 3 sticks (339 g) salted butter
- :egg: 2 large eggs
- :glass_of_milk: 1.5 cups (341 g) [buttermilk][1]
- :strawberry: some [strawberry jam][2] (optional)

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 large bowl
- 1 pastry blender
- 1 wooden spoon
- 1 baking sheet
- 1 parchment paper
- 1 2 3/4-inch round cutter
- 1 small dish

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

In a large bowl, whisk together the self-rising flour, baking powder, and baking soda. Add the salted butter cut into
1/2-inch pieces and use a pastry blender to cut the butter into the flour until the pieces are even and about the
size of peas.

### Step 2

Stir in the beaten large eggs with a wooden spoon until combined. Stir in 1.5 cups [buttermilk][1] until the dough
comes together into a sticky mass. If it is too dry, add more buttermilk 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing after each
addition, until it reaches the correct consistency. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up
to overnight.

### Step 3

Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

### Step 4

Scrape the dough onto a floured work surface. Use your floured hands to press it into a round roughly 14 inches across
and about 1/2-inch thick.

### Step 5

Use a floured 2 3/4-inch round cutter to cut out about 20 biscuits. If necessary, collect and pat out the scraps to cut
more biscuits.

### Step 6

Transfer the biscuits to the prepared baking sheet, arranging them so that they all are touching.

### Step 7

In a small dish, beat together the remaining egg and 1 tablespoon buttermilk. Brush the mixture on the top of the
biscuits.

### Step 8

Bake until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool slightly in the pan on a rack.

### Step 9

Biscuits are best the day they are made (and ideally fresh out of the oven!). Serve with [strawberry jam][2] or
[gravy][3], if desired. Store leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days.
