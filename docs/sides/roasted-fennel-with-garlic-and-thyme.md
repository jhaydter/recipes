| 2 | 25 minutes |

## :salt: Ingredients

- :leafy_green: 1 large bulb fennel
- :olive: 1 Tbsp olive oil
- :garlic: 0.5 tsp garlic powder
- :herb: 0.5 tsp thyme
- :salt: 0.25 tsp salt
- :salt: 0.25 tsp black pepper

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 large baking sheet
- 1 parchment paper

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 400°F (204°C) and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. If making a larger batch, use
more baking sheets.

### Step 2

Chop off and discard the fennel stalks and fronds (or save for making vegetable broth). Then slice the fennel bulb in
half through the core and cut out and discard the triangular core from each half. Thinly slice both halves of the fennel
bulb — 1 large bulb should yield about 2.5 cups or 200 g sliced.

### Step 3

Add the sliced fennel to the parchment-lined baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with the remaining
ingredients (garlic powder, thyme, salt, and black pepper). Toss to evenly coat and arrange in a single layer.

### Step 4

Bake for 15 minutes, then toss, arrange back in a single layer, and bake for another 5 to 10 minutes until golden brown
on the edges and tender when pierced with a fork. Watch closely near the end to avoid burning.

### Step 5

Best served warm with other Italian-inspired recipes or on pasta, salads, or pizza. Not freezer friendly.
