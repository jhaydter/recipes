- :corn: 2 cups masa harina
- :salt: 0.5 tsp salt
- :droplet: 1.5 cups hot water

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 large bowl

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

In a large bowl mix the masa harina with the salt.

### Step 2

Add the hot water and stir with a wooden spoon to combine. Then knead the dough with your hands for about a minute,
until it feels like play-doh.

### Step 3

Cover bowl with a damp dishtowel and let rest for 10 minutes.

### Step 4

Now make 12 to 14 dough balls shaping them into the size of a golf ball. (You can use a 2-tablespoon cookie scoop if you
have one.) If the dough feels dry, wet your hands and it will help soften the dough as you roll.

### Step 5

A tortilla press works best for pressing the tortillas into a 5-inch circle. To use one, cut a large plastic bag into 2
full-size, single pieces. Place one on the bottom plate, place one dough ball on top, then place another plastic piece
on top. Now press down the tortilla press and when you pull up, you will have a perfect tortilla. If you don't have a
tortilla press, place each dough ball in between 2 pieces of parchment paper and roll out to a 4- to 5-inch circle with
a rolling pin.

### Step 6

Heat up a non-stick skillet to medium-high and put one tortilla in at a time. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes on each side until
it has brown spots on the surface. Wrap cooked tortillas in a damp dishtowel to keep them soft until you serve them.
