## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Heat the oven (with the oven rack in the middle) to 400Â°F. Pierce the sweet potatoes several times with the tines of a
fork. Place them on a sheet pan and bake for about 45 minutes, or until very tender.

### Step 2

While the potatoes bake, caramelize the shallots: thinly slice the shallots into rings. In a medium skillet, heat the
olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt. Cook, stirring often, for 8 to 10
minutes, until tender and caramelized. Pull the thyme leaves from their sprigs and stir into the shallots. Remove from
the heat.

### Step 3

Cut open the potatoes and scoop the flesh into a bowl. Add the butter, black pepper, and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of
salt. Mash. Add the whole milk and mash until creamy. If you want them a little creamier, add a little more milk.

### Step 4

Serve the sweet potatoes topped with the caramelized shallots.
