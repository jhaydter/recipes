- :banana: 4 green plantain
- :salt: some salt

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 deep fry pan

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

In a deep fry pan, heat about 1 inch of vegetable oil on medium-high heat until it's hot. (To test oil temp, dip the
handle of a wooden spoon into the oil. When the oil bubbles around the stick, it's ready for frying.)

### Step 2

In batches, fry green plantain pieces about 2 to 3 minutes on both sides, until lightly golden. Remove plantains from
pan and drain on a plate covered with 2 or 3 paper towels.

### Step 3

While still warm, use the bottom of a glass to flatten the fried plantain pieces until they are about 1/4-inch thick.

### Step 4

Heat oil again and return flattened plantain rounds into the oil. Fry until both sides are golden brown, about 2 to 3
minutes per side. Drain on a paper towel- lined plate.

### Step 5

Season with salt to taste and serve with refried beans, cashew cream, or chilero hot sauce for dipping.
