## :pencil: Instructions

!!! note

    Use any mix of white, cremini, shiitake, portobello, oyster, maitake, and/or king oyster mushrooms you like, as
    long as the caps measure at least 2 inches in diameter. A grill basket is helpful here but not essential. These
    mushrooms make a great accompaniment to other grilled foods. The parcooked mushrooms can be refrigerated for up to
    24 hours.

### Step 1

Melt butter in small saucepan over medium heat. Add soy sauce, rosemary, minced garlic, lemon zest, and 1/2 teaspoon
pepper and cook, stirring frequently, until mixture is simmering and fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Cover
to keep warm until ready to use.

### Step 2

Trim tough ends of stems on white and cremini mushrooms and cut in half. Remove stems from shiitake mushrooms. Remove
stems from portobello mushrooms and halve caps if smaller than 4 inches; quarter if larger. Trim oyster and maitake
mushrooms and tear into 2 to 2.5 inch pieces. Trim stems on king oyster mushrooms and slice crosswise 3/4 inch thick.

### Step 3

Combine mushrooms and 1/2 cup water in bowl. Cover and microwave for 1 minute. Stir well; re-cover; and microwave until
mushrooms have reduced in size by about one-third and liquid has increased to almost 1 cup, about 2 minutes. Remove from
microwave and let rest, covered, for 5 minutes to finish cooking. Drain well. Dry bowl and return mushrooms to bowl. Let
stand at room temperature while preparing grill.

### Step 4A

FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter three-quarters filled with charcoal
briquettes (about 4.5 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over half of grill. Set
cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.

### Step 4B

FOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high; cover; and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Leave primary burner on
high and turn off other burner(s).

### Step 5

Clean and oil cooking grate. Toss mushrooms with vegetable oil, salt, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Arrange
mushrooms on hotter side of grill. Cook (covered if using gas), flipping mushrooms every 2 minutes, until well browned
on all sides, 4 to 6 minutes. Carefully brush mushrooms with half of basting butter and continue to cook until butter is
sizzling and fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Transfer to bowl with remaining basting butter and toss to combine. Season
with salt and pepper to taste, and serve.
