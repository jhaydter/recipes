## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 275Â°F.

### Step 2

Slice the Yukon gold potatoes into 1/4 inch slices and immediately put them in a pot with 4 cups of heavy cream with the
nutmeg, garlic and salt and pepper. Cook the potatoes until 90% cooked. Be sure they do not break up too much.

### Step 3

Removed the partly cooked potatoes into a large plate or another lasagna pan to stop the cooking process.

### Step 4

Add the cheddar, Gruyere, and Mozzarella to the cream mixture, reserving 1/2 of the mozzarella for the top. Mix well
until all the cheese has melted. Add salt and pepper to taste.

### Step 5

Rub the 8 x 11 pan's bottom with butter and arrange your first layer of the potatoes, top with some cream mixture, top
with more potatoes and continue until you have used all your potatoes.

### Step 6

Top the dish with the remaining mozzarella. Place the lasagna pan into a cookie sheet (in case your dish overflow) and
place in a preheated oven until golden brown, about 1.5 hours.
