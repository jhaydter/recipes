### Step 1

Put the sweet potatoes in a steamer basket over 1 inch of simmering water and cover tightly. Steam for about 30 minutes,
or until they can be easily pierced with a paring knife. Remove from the basket. When cool enough to handle, slice them
in half lengthwise.

### Step 2

For the chimichurri, in a small bowl, combine the finely chopped shallot, parsley, cilantro, sherry or red wine vinegar,
4 tablespoons of the olive oil, the salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes. Stir to combine.

### Step 3

Heat the grill to medium-high.

### Step 4

Drizzle the sweet potatoes with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and rub to coat. Sprinkle with a little salt and pepper.

### Step 5

Place the sweet potatoes cut side down on the grill. Grill for 5 to 10 minutes, until grill marks form. Flip over and
grill 2 minutes more.

### Step 6

Transfer the sweet potatoes to a serving plate and drizzle with the chimichurri.
