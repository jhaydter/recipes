## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Heat the oven to 425Â°F.

### Step 2

Cut the broccoli florets from the thick stalks, leaving an inch or two of stalk attached to the florets discarding the
rest of the stalks. Cut the larger pieces through the base of the head with a small knife, pulling the florets apart.
You should have about 8 cups of florets. Place the broccoli florets on a sheet pan large enough to hold them in a single
layer. Toss the garlic on the broccoli and drizzle with 5 tablespoons olive oil. Sprinkle with the salt and pepper.
Roast for 20 to 25 minutes, until crisp-tender and the tips of some of the florets are browned.

### Step 3

Remove the broccoli from the oven and immediately toss with 1.5 tablespoons olive oil, the lemon zest, lemon juice,
toasted pine nuts, Parmesan, and julienned fresh basil. Serve hot.
