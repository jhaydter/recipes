### Step 1

Preheat oven to 400 F and line baking sheets with parchment paper.

### Step 2

Add all-purpose flour, baking powder, sugar, and 1/2 tsp of salt to the food processor and give a quick pulse to
combine.

### Step 3

Add 6 tablespoons of cold butter a few small pats at a time, and pulse to combine then. Then slowly add vegetable oil
slowly with the food processor running.

### Step 4

While the food processor is pulsing, add water a little bit at a time until a dough starts to form into a ball.

### Step 5

On a floured surface, roll dough out as thin as you can with a rolling pin. Add more flour if needed when it sticks.

### Step 6

Use 2 inch ravioli stamp to cut the dough out and add cut outs to baking sheets. Continue to roll out dough and cut out
crackers until all the dough is used up and place them on parchment lined baking sheet.

### Step 7

Poke holes in each of the crackers: 2, 3, and 2.

### Step 8

Brush the cracker cut outs with the egg wash and sprinkle with a kosher salt

### Step 9

### Step 10

Melt remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and then brush with melted butter while still hot.

### Step 11

Cool and enjoy!
