## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat over to 400° F

### Step 2

Add einkorn flour, baking powder, and salt to food processor and pulse until well combined.

### Step 3

Add cold butter in small cubes, pulse until crumbly.

### Step 4

Add honey and milk, pulse until ball forms.

### Step 5

If dough is still very sticky, add a bit more flour and pulse again.

### Step 6

Remove dough from food processor and divide into two balls to roll out separately.

### Step 7

Using a rolling pin, roll dough to about 1/8" thick. Using a pizza cutter, cut the dough into whatever size crackers
you'd like.

### Step 8

Poke holes into each cracker with a fork. I like to do 3 to 4 rows of holes to make them look like the store-bought
version.

### Step 9

Transfer crackers to baking tray and bake at 400° for 10 minutes, or until golden brown.

### Step 10

Remove from oven and immediately brush crackers with melted butter. Sprinkle with salt to taste.

### Step 11

Allow to cool completely before storing in an air tight container.
