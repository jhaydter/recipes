## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Place the white potatoes in a large pot and fill it with enough salted water to cover them. Bring the water to a boil
and continue to cook for 20 minutes, or until the potatoes are fork-tender. Drain and set aside to cool.

### Step 2

Meanwhile, make the dressing. Whisk together the 2 eggs, granulated sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a saucepan over
medium heat. Mix in the apple cider vinegar, milk, and yellow mustard. Continue to cook, stirring continuously for about
10 minutes, or until thick.

### Step 3

Remove from heat and mix in the unsalted butter. Allow the dressing to cool in the fridge. Mix in the [mayonnaise][1].

### Step 4

Peel the potatoes, if desired. Slice them into bite-sized cubes and place them in a large bowl. Mix in the onion, finely
chopped, chopped celery, carrots, celery seed, and 4 hard-boiled eggs. Gently toss in the dressing. Refrigerate for at
least 1 hour, better if overnight. Serve chilled and enjoy!
