!!! note

    Even though we used 2/3 cup, we found that the type of honey didn’t affect the flavor of the cornbread much—except
    with very strong honey, such as buckwheat. That lent a distinctive deep, molasses-y flavor that some of our tasters
    didn’t like. The test kitchen’s favorite cornmeal is Anson Mills Fine Yellow Cornmeal.

### Step 1

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375°F. Grease 8-inch square baking pan. Whisk buttermilk, honey,
eggs, and melted unsalted butter in bowl until thoroughly combined and no streaks of honey remain. Whisk all-purpose
flour, cornmeal, salt, baking powder, and baking soda together in large bowl.

### Step 2

Whisk buttermilk mixture into flour mixture until thoroughly combined. Transfer batter to prepared pan. Bake until
golden brown and toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool in pan for 5 minutes. Remove
cornbread from pan and let cool on wire rack for 15 to 20 minutes. Serve.
