## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

To make the biga, mix all-purpose flour, instant yeast, and water in a medium bowl, cover the bowl, and let rest for
about 12 hours, or overnight.

### Step 2

To make the dough, use your fingers to pull the biga into walnut-size pieces, and place the pieces in the bowl of a
stand mixer.

### Step 3

Add instant yeast, nonfat dry milk, salt, water, olive oil, and all-purpose flour to the biga and beat slowly with a
flat beater paddle or beaters for about 3 minutes.

### Step 4

Replace the beater paddle with the dough hook, increase the speed to medium, and knead for 10 minutes. The dough should
be very sticky and slack.

### Step 5

Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl or dough-rising bucket, cover the bowl or bucket, and let the dough rise
for 2 to 3 hours, gently deflating it and turning it over every 45 minutes or so.

### Step 6

Transfer the dough to a lightly greased work surface and use a bench knife or dough scraper to divide it in half.

### Step 7

Working with one half at a time, shape the dough into a rough log.

### Step 8

Transfer the log to a parchment-lined baking sheet, or one sprinkled with cornmeal or semolina, and flatten it into an
irregular 10" X 4" oval.

### Step 9

Use your fingers, your entire finger, not just the tip, to indent the surface of the dough vigorously and thoroughly.
Repeat with the remaining piece of dough.

### Step 10

Cover the loaves with heavily greased plastic wrap or reusable cover, and set them aside to rise until very puffy, 2 to
3 hours, depending on the warmth of your kitchen.

### Step 11

Half an hour before you want to make the bread, preheat the oven to 425°F. Spritz water into the oven with a clean
plant mister for about 5 seconds. Place the bread in the oven and spritz water into the oven three more times during the
first 10 minutes of baking.

### Step 12

Bake the loaves for total of about 25 minutes, or until they're a deep golden brown and their interior temperature
measures 210°F.

### Step 13

Remove the loaves from the pan and return them to the oven. Turn off the oven, crack the door open a couple of inches,
and let the loaves cool completely in the oven.

### Step 14

Dust the loaves generously with flour.
