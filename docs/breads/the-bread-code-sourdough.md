## :pencil: Instructions

### Autolyse

### Step 1

At night, mix bread flour, whole wheat flour, and water in a bowl, fully hydrating the flour. Let it rest,
covered, at room temperature over night for 12 hours. Make sure that there are no crumbly parts of flour left.

### Bulk Fermentation

### Step 2

The next morning, add the active starter to the main dough.

### Step 3

Add the salt to the main dough.

### Step 4

Mix until everything is nicely homogenized (very important).

### Step 5

For me this takes around 1 minute. It might take you up to 5 minutes.

### Step 6

You want to make sure the sourdough starter has been evenly spread across the dough.

### Step 7

Let the dough sit for another 15 minutes covered.

### Step 8

Now remove the dough and place it on your bench (no flour!)

### Step 9

Extract a small sample from the dough and place it in a cylindrical shaped container. A shot glass works, or anything
else that has a cylindrical shape. This sample will tell us exactly when the dough is done bulk fermenting. Mark the
dough with a rubber band or a marker. This way we can see the size increase.

### Step 10

Let the dough sit for another 15 minutes covered.

### Step 11

Proceed with kneading the dough on the bench. It’s important that you have no flour on the surface.

### Step 12

Pull the dough as far out as you can, without tearing it.

### Step 13

Fold over the dough to glue itself together.

### Step 14

Repeat once from each side.

### Step 15

Drag the dough over the surface using your hands at a 45° angle.

### Step 16

This only works because the dough is stuck on the surface.

### Step 17

Your dough ball should become nice and round.

### Step 18

Wait a minute, repeat the same process 3 times.

### Step 19

Add dough to container and wait 2 hours or until the dough has doubled in size.

### Step 20

Slightly wet hands with cold water.

### Step 21

Release dough from sides of container.

### Step 22

Using a very light touch, do a coil fold. Do 2 opposite sides, then 3rd side pull dough under and then 4th side roll it
over.

### Step 23

Return to container and cover and wait until the dough doubles in size.

### Step 24

This can take anywhere between 4 and 12 hours. Every 2 hours, do the coil fold.

### Shaping the Dough

### Step 25

Prepare your banneton (if using) and very lightly flour counter/surface.

### Step 26

Flip dough out onto it. Do letter fold and stick dough together. Pinch ends closed (for oval loaf). Pinch bottom seam
together, for more tension (for boule).

### Step 27

Lightly sprinkle flour over top (and rice flour along sides of banneton, to prevent sticking).

### Proofing Stage

### Step 28

Will take 2 to 4 hours at room temperature (until the finger poke test is passed). Place shortly before
the finger poke test passes in the freezer for 45 minutes to make scoring easier.

### Step 29

Or - place for 1 hour at room temperature, then another 6 to 24 hours in the fridge. This way your bread will be ready
directly for breakfast.

### Baking

### Step 30

Preheat oven at 450°F for maximum for at least 30 minutes.

### Step 31

If using Dutch oven, heat it in the oven for about 30 minutes (lid separated).

### Step 32

If baking on sheet or stone, heat stone and sheet while heating oven.

### Step 33

Also heat the container (e.g. cast iron skillet) at the bottom of the oven to use to create steam).

### Step 34

Place inverted baking tray (with sides) on uppermost rack of oven after putting in bread, to catch the steam. At 30
minutes, remove this tray and the water container.

### Step 35

Gently turn dough out of banneton onto parchment, or directly into hot dutch oven (careful!).

### Step 36

Score dough to control where you will have oven spring. This takes a few attempts. You can practice this when you
initially kneaded and made a smooth ball.

### Step 37

Place in Dutch oven or on baking stone or sheet.

### Step 38

Bake for 30 minutes covered.

### Step 39

Remove lid of Dutch oven or remove top inverted tray and water container (if using).

### Step 40

This makes sure we no longer have steam. That way you will develop a nice crust.

### Step 41

Bake for 15 to 20 minutes more until your bread has your personal desired color.

### Step 42

It is ready when the core temperature reached 203°F.

### Resting Stage

### Step 43

Let the bread cool on a cooling rack for at least 2 hours.
