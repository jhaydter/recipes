## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 small bowl
- 1 stand mixer
- 1 greased bowl
- 1 damp towel
- 1 small saucepan
- 1 8.5 x 4.5 inch loaf pans
- 1 loaf pan
- 1 medium saucepan

## :pencil: Instructions - Dough

### Step 1

For the dough: Place the dry active yeast and 1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar in a small bowl. Add the lukewarm water and
stir gently to mix. Set aside until foamy, 5 to 10 minutes. In a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, mix together the
all-purpose flour, 1/3 cup granulated sugar, and 2 teaspoons vanilla.

### Step 2

In a medium saucepan, scald the milk (bring almost to a boil, until milk is just simmering). Allow to sit for 1 minute
to cool just slightly.

### Step 3

With mixer on low, add the water and​yeast mixture, milk, and melted butter. Add the eggs one at a time.

### Step 4

When the dough begins to come together, after 2 to 3 minutes, turn off the mixer and scrape down the sides. Raise the
speed to high and mix for another 5 to 10 minutes until the dough is shiny, elastic, and smooth. It may seem like a long
time to mix, but the result is worth the wait.

### Step 5

Place dough in a greased bowl with a damp towel on top. Allow to rise 1 to 2 hours.

## :pencil: Instructions - Syrup

### Step 6

Make the sugar syrup while the dough is rising: Combine the water, granulated sugar, and vanilla in a small saucepan.
Bring to a low boil until the sugar has dissolved. Set aside and cool. This syrup can be kept in the fridge for 2 to 3
months and makes enough for at least 2 batches of babka (6 medium babkas).

### Step 7

Prepare three greased 8.5 x 4.5 inch loaf pans. Note: you can also make two larger round babkas that can be baked on
baking sheets.

### Step 8

To make the chocolate filling, beat 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) room temperature unsalted butter with 1/2 cup granulated
sugar until smooth. Add 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 6 ounces melted dark chocolate (you can also use good-quality
dark chocolate chips), 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, and a pinch of salt.

### Step 9

Cut the dough into three equal parts (use a food scale for precision). Roll out one part into a rectangle. Spread
one-third of the 1 to 1.5 cups of chocolate or cinnamon sugar filling onto the rectangle and roll up along the shorter
side (to create swirls inside).

### Step 10

Once the dough is formed into a swirled log, cut it straight down the middle so the filling is exposed.

### Step 11

Cut 1/2 inch off each end.

### Step 12

Layer each cut piece on top of one another and twist. Place in a greased loaf pan.

### Step 13

Repeat with the other two pieces of babka dough. Lightly drape a kitchen towel over the top of the pans. Allow to rise
another 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 350°F while the dough rises.

### Step 14

Bake for 20 minutes. Brush each babka with two layers of sugar syrup. Place back in the oven for approximately 15
minutes. The edges should be slightly brown and the middle should be slightly doughy.

### Step 15

When the babkas come out of the oven, immediately brush each with another 3 light layers of sugar syrup. Allow to cool
for 5 to 10 minutes. Using a butter knife, loosen the sides of the babka from the pan and place on top of wire rack to
cool.
