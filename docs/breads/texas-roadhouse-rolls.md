## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 small saucepan

## :pencil: Instructions - Dough

### Step 1

In a small saucepan over medium heat, heat whole milk until warm to the touch, between 100°F to 110°F. In the large
bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine warm milk, granulated sugar, and active dry yeast. Let sit
until yeast is dissolved and foamy, about 10 minutes.

### Step 2

Add eggs, butter, and kosher salt and beat on low speed until just combined. Add all-purpose flour and continue to beat
on low speed until dough comes together, about 5 minutes.

### Step 3

Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, about 5 minutes. Transfer dough to a lightly oiled
bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour.

### Step 4

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Return dough to lightly floured surface and roll to a 1" thick rectangle. Using a
sharp knife or pizza cutter, cut dough into 2" squares. Transfer squares to prepared sheets, spacing about 1/2" apart.
Cover each sheet with a dish towel and let rise until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.

## :pencil: Instructions - Cinnamon-Honey Butter

### Step 5

In a large bowl, whisk confectioners’ sugar, honey, kosher salt, cinnamon, and 1 stick butter until thoroughly
combined and fluffy.

### Step 6

Preheat oven to 375°F. Melt remaining 1/2 stick butter in the microwave or in a small pot. Brush each square with
butter.

### Step 7

Bake rolls until golden brown and risen, about 15 minutes.

### Step 8

Brush rolls with more melted butter and sprinkle with sea salt, if using. Serve with cinnamon-honey butter alongside.

!!! info "Make Ahead"

    Rolls can be made 1 month ahead. Let cool, tightly wrap in foil, then in plastic wrap, and freeze. When
    ready to eat, let rolls thaw at room temperature overnight. Remove plastic wrap and loosen foil, then bake at 300°F for
    10 minutes to heat through. Cinnamon-honey butter can be made 7 days ahead. Store in an airtight container and
    refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before serving.
