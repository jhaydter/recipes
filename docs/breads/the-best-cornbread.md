## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Lightly grease an 8 x 8 or 9 x 9 inch baking pan (I always use metal; glass pans will bake
differently).

### Step 2

For the cornbread, in a large bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, and
salt. Add the oil, butter, melted, eggs, beaten, and milk and stir with a whisk or rubber spatula until just combined.
The batter will be runny.

### Step 3

Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes until a toothpick inserted in the center comes
out clean or with a few moist crumbs.

### Step 4

For the honey butter, whip the honey, unsalted butter, and marshmallow fluff together with an electric mixer. Best
served at room temperature so it is soft and spreadable.
