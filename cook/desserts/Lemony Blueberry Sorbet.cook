Rinse and remove the stems from the @blueberries{3%cups}. Wipe them off as much as possible. Freeze the blueberries on a #parchment{}-lined #baking sheet{} for ~{4%hours} or overnight so they are completely frozen.

Once frozen, add the blueberries, @honey{3%Tbsp}, @lemon juice{1} (save the zest for later) and water to the bowl of a #food processor{}. Process the blueberries until they become crumbly, pressing down the mixture with a #spatula{} as needed. Continue to process until the blueberries becomes very smooth. You will have to mix a few times with the spatula to ensure even processing. This process will take at least ~{8%minutes} or so. Fold in the @lemon zest{1}.

Transfer the sorbet to an airtight container and freeze for another ~{30%minutes} or longer. Enjoy!
