Preheat the oven to 350°F and butter or grease a baking dish (Ina’s recipe uses a #14 x 9 in oval baking dish{}). Peel and core the @apples{5%lbs} and cut them into large wedges. Mix the apples with the @orange zest{1}, @lemon zest{1}, @orange juice{2%Tbsp}, @lemon juice{2%Tbsp}, @sugar{1/2%cup}, @cinnamon{2%tsp} and @nutmeg{1%tsp}. Pour the mixture into the dish.

Combine the @all-purpose flour{1.5%cups}, @granulated sugar{3/4%cup}, @brown sugar{3/4%cup}, @salt{1/2%tsp}, @quick-cooking oats{1%cup} and @cold butter{2%sticks} in the bowl of a #stand mixer{} fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on low speed until the mixture is crumbly and the butter is the size of peas.

Scatter the oat topping evenly over the apples. Place the baking dish on a #sheet pan{} and bake the crisp for ~{1%hour} until the top is brown and the apples are bubbly. Serve warm.
