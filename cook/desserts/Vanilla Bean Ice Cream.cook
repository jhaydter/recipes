Make a cr√®me anglaise custard using @granulated sugar{150%g}, @egg yolks{4%large}, @whole milk{570%g}, @heavy cream{270%g}, @vanilla pod{1}, and a pinch of @salt{1%pinch}.

Pour the custard into a #zip-top bag{} and press every last bit of air out. Seal it tightly and place it flat in the freezer. Allow to freeze completely.

Crumble the frozen custard into your #food processor{} and process until completely smooth. At this point, you can stir in any mix-ins or additional flavorings you want.

Scrape the ice cream into a storage container and place back in the freezer.
