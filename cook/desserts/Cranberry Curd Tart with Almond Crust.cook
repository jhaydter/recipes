You'll need a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom for this recipe. We strongly recommend weighing the almond flour and cornstarch for the crust. If preferred, you can use a stand mixer or handheld mixer to whip the cream in step 4. The tart crust will be firm if you serve the tart on the day that it's made; if you prefer a more tender crust, make the tart through step 3 up to two days ahead. For tips on how to pipe the whipped cream into decorative patterns, see note.

Bring @cranberries{1%lb}, 1.25 cups @granulated sugar{1.25%cups}, @water{1/2%cup}, and @salt{1%pinch} to boil in #medium saucepan{} over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Adjust heat to maintain very gentle simmer. Cover and cook until all cranberries have burst and started to shrivel, about ~{10%minutes}. While cranberries cook, whisk @egg yolks{3%large} and @cornstarch{2%tsp} in bowl until smooth. Transfer hot cranberry mixture to #food processor{}. Immediately add yolk mixture and process until smooth (small flecks of cranberry skin will be visible), about ~{1%minute}, scraping down sides of bowl as necessary. Let mixture cool in processor bowl until skin forms and mixture registers 120 to 125°F, 45 minutes to ~{1%hour}. While mixture cools, make crust.

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350°F. Whisk @almond flour{4%oz}, @cornstarch{2%oz}, @granulated sugar{2.33%oz}, and @salt{1/2%tsp} in bowl until well combined. Add @melted butter{6%Tbsp} and @almond extract{3/4%tsp} and stir with wooden spoon until uniform dough forms. Crumble two-thirds of mixture over bottom of #9 inch tart pan{} with removable bottom. Press dough to even thickness in bottom of pan. Crumble remaining dough and scatter evenly around edge of pan. Press crumbled dough into sides of pan. Press edges to even thickness. Place pan on #rimmed baking sheet{} and bake until crust is golden brown, about ~{20%minutes}, rotating pan halfway through baking.

Add @softened butter{4%Tbsp} to cranberry puree and process until fully combined, about 30 seconds. Strain mixture through fine-mesh strainer set over bowl, pressing on solids with #rubber spatula{} to extract puree. Transfer 2 tablespoons puree to medium bowl, then stir in @heavy cream{1%cup} and remaining 1 tablespoon sugar. Cover and refrigerate. Transfer remaining puree to crust (it's OK if crust is still warm) and smooth into even layer. Let tart sit at room temperature for at least ~{4%hours}. (Cover tart with large bowl and refrigerate after 4 hours if making ahead.)

Whisk cream mixture until stiff peaks form, 1 to 3 minutes. Transfer to #pastry bag{} fitted with pastry tip. Pipe decorative border around edge of tart. Transfer any remaining whipped cream to small serving bowl.
