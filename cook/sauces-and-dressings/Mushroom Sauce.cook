In a #sauce pan{}, heat 1 tablespoon @unsalted butter{1%Tbsp}, when hot, add @shallots{2%Tbsp} and cook until light golden brown and add the @mushrooms{2%cups} and the @salt{} and cook until they have released most of their water (this could take 7 to ~{10%minutes}).

Add the @tarragon{2%Tbsp}, @garlic{2%Tbsp} and when fragrant (about 15 to 20 seconds) add the @Balsamic vinegar{2%Tbsp} and @red wine{1%cup} and let it reduce until about half of it remain. Add @vegetable stock{1.5%cups}, add @salt{} and @pepper{} to taste and cook for 15 to ~{20%minutes}. Add @heavy cream{3%Tbsp} and @parsley{1%Tbsp} if you like.

Adjust the thickness of the sauce with unsalted butter or @cornstarch (optional){2%Tbsp} when boiling a little bit at a time and at the last minutes add as much butter as you like. Chef adds at least 2 large tablespoons!!!
