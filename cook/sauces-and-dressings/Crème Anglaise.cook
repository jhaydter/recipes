Pour the @whole milk{200%ml} and @heavy cream{100%ml} into a #small pan{} over a low heat. Add the @vanilla paste{1/4%tsp} and bring slowly to a simmer.

In a #medium bowl{}, whisk the @egg yolks{3%large} and @granulated sugar{40%g} together until pale. Pour the mixture over the warm milk, whisking continuously, then pour into a clean, #heavy-based pan{} and cook over a very low heat.

Simmer the mixture gently for 3 to ~{4%minutes}, stirring continuously, until smooth and thick enough to coat the back of a #spoon{}. Remove from the heat, cover the surface with #clingfilm{} to prevent a skin forming, then leave to cool.
