In a #Dutch oven{}, heat a little extra virgin @olive oil{2%Tbsp} and saut√© the @onion{1.5%cup} until lightly caramelized, about ~{4%minutes}. Add the @celery{1/2%cup} and @carrots{1/2%cup} and cook for 1 to ~{2%minutes}.

In a #frying pan{}, add a couple spoons of olive oil and when hot add the @vegetarian sausage{1.5%lbs} and brown until caramelized. Constantly breaking the sausage up while it cooks so you have small uniform crumbles. When deep golden brown, remove the meat from the pan and drain any extra fat.

Back in the Dutch oven, add the @mushrooms{1/2%lb} and sweat them for ~{5%minutes} or however long it takes to eliminate the water. Add the @fresh thyme{1%Tbsp} and @garlic{2%Tbsp} when fragrant, chopped @tomatoes{2%28-oz cans} and @tomato puree{1.5%cups}. Add the cooked vegetarian meat, adjust with @salt{} and @pepper{} and let simmer slowly for ~{45%minutes}.

Add the @parsley{1/4%cup} at the end.
