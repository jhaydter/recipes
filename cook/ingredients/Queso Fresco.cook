Line #colander{} with four layers of #cheesecloth{} or 2 layers of food-safe paper towels and set over large bowl.

Heat @whole milk{l%gal} in a #large pot{} over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until it registers 165 to 180Â°F on an #instant-read thermometer{}. Add the @lemon juice or vinegar{2/3%cup} 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring gently after each addition. Stop adding the acid when the curds separate from the whey: you will see white clumps of curd suspended in a pale translucent whey. Let sit uncovered for at least 5 minutes and up to ~{20%minutes} while the separation finishes.

Using #slotted spoon or wire skimmer{}, transfer curds to prepared colander, cover exposed top with #plastic wrap{}, and allow to drain until desired texture is reached, about ~{20%minutes} if using for pressed cheese (see step 3), or an hour for fresh curds.

Gently stir in @salt{} to taste.
