Certain herbs are known to pair well with particular foods: rosemary with lamb, tarragon with chicken, basil with tomatoes, and fennel with fish so it is best to keep these combinations in mind when mixing your herbs. You might want to try making separate batches, each with different ratios of herbs for use in various recipes. Just be sure to label your containers.
