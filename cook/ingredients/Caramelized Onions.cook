In a #Dutch oven{} at very low heat, cook the @onions{4%large} covered (no oil, no water nothing) just the onions for about 60 to ~{90%minutes}. When cooked drain and set aside.

After the onions have drained all the water, in a #saut√© pan{}, heat the @olive oil{1%Tbsp} and @sweet butter{2%Tbsp} at a medium heat, add the drained onion and cook until light golden brown.

Add the @light brown sugar{1/2%cup} and the @balsamic vinegar{1/2%cup}. Cook for at least ~{10%minutes} at very low heat. Season with @salt{} and @pepper{}. The onions are supposed to be NOT sweet NOT sour.
