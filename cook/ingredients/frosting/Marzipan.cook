Put @ground almonds{300%g}, @granulated sugar{100%g}, @confectioners' sugar{350%g}, and @almond essence (optional){2%drops} into a #food processor{} and pulse until the mixture comes together into a fine powder. Gently add the @egg white{2} and whiz the whole lot together until it comes together.

Dust a work surface with some icing sugar, then tip the marzipan dough out. Gently bring it together with your hands until it makes a smooth dough. You donâ€™t want it to be sticky at this point, so you may need to add more icing sugar.

Then simply roll the marzipan out; ready to cover your cake.
