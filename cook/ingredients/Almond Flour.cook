Preheat the oven to 350ºF.

When the @blanched almonds{1%lb} have all been forcibly removed from their jackets, spread them out on a #cookie sheet{} and roast in the oven until they are quite dry. This will take between 10 and ~{15%minutes}. Watch closely to make sure they don’t brown too much, although, depending on the recipe you’re intending to use them for, a darker, more roasted taste may be desirable. If you have time to let them sit, turn off the oven and let them sit there all night to dry out even more.

When the almonds are toasted and quite dry, blend them in a #food processor{}. Do not overfill the food processor; it’s good to only fill the bowl about half full. Grind in short, quick bursts until the meal is a fine texture. Depending on your food processor and how dry the almonds are, this may not get to the finest flour consistency. If it begins to clump together or turn to butter, it has been over-ground.
