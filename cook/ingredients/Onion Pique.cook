Trim off the root end of half a peeled @onion{1/2}.

Attach a @bay leaf{1} to the cut-side of the onion using 2 or 3 @whole dried cloves{2} as pins.

Add to a pot of stock or milk to cook for about 20 minutes. Remove, squeeze out the liquid, and discard when the stock or milk is finished.

Onion clout√©: Leave out the bay leaf and just spike your onion with cloves.
