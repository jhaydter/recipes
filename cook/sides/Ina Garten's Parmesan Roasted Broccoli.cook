>> serves: 6
>> total time: 30 minutes

Heat the oven to 425Â°F.

Cut the @broccoli{4%lb} florets from the thick stalks, leaving an inch or two of stalk attached to the florets discarding the rest of the stalks. Cut the larger pieces through the base of the head with a small knife, pulling the florets apart. You should have about 8 cups of florets. Place the broccoli florets on a #sheet pan{} large enough to hold them in a single layer. Toss the @garlic{4%cloves} on the broccoli and drizzle with 5 tablespoons @olive oil{6.5%Tbsp}. Sprinkle with the @salt{1.5%tsp} and @pepper{1/2%tsp}. Roast for 20 to ~{25%minutes}, until crisp-tender and the tips of some of the florets are browned.

Remove the broccoli from the oven and immediately toss with 1.5 tablespoons olive oil, the @lemon zest{2%tsp}, @lemon juice{2%Tbsp}, @toasted pine nuts{3%Tbsp}, @Parmesan{0.33%cups}, and @julienned fresh basil{12%leaves}. Serve hot.
