Place the @small white potatoes{3%lbs} and 2 tablespoons of @salt{2%Tbsp} in a #large pot{} of water. Bring the water to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 10 to ~{15%minutes}, until the potatoes are just slightly tender when pierced with a knife.

Drain the potatoes into a #colander{}. Set the colander over the empty pot and cover it with a #clean kitchen towel{}. Allow the potatoes to steam for another 15 to ~{20%minutes}, until theyâ€™re tender but not mushy.

Meanwhile, in a #small bowl{}, whisk together the @mayonnaise{1%cup}, @buttermilk{1/4%cup}, @Dijon mustard{2%Tbsp}, @whole-grain mustard{2%Tbsp}, @dill{1/2%cup}, 1 teaspoon of @salt{1%tsp} and 1 teaspoon of @pepper{1%tsp}. Set aside.

When the potatoes are cool enough to handle but still warm, cut them into bite-size chunks. Place the cut-up potatoes in a large bowl and immediately pour the dressing over them. Add the @celery{1/2%cup} and @red onion{1/2%cup}, 2 teaspoons of @salt{2%tsp} and 1 teaspoon of @pepper{1%tsp}. Toss until the dressing coats every bite. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for a few hours to allow the flavors to blend. Serve cold or at room temperature.
