In a #medium bowl{}, whisk together the @all-purpose flour{2%cups}, @almond meal or flour{1/2%cup}, @baking powder{2%tsp}, and @salt{1/2%tsp}. In a #small liquid measuring cup{}, whisk together the @whole milk{1/2%cup} and the @vanilla{1%tsp}.

In the bowl of a #stand mixer{} fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the @granulated sugar{1%cup} and @unsalted butter{1/2%cup}. Beat on medium-high until light, fluffy, and doubled in volume, 2 to ~{3%minutes}, using a #rubber spatula{} to scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl as necessary. Reduce the mixer to low and add the @eggs{2%large} one at a time, adding the next egg only after the previous one is fully incorporated, scraping down the bottom and sides of the bowl after each addition.

With the mixer still on low, add the dry ingredients in three equal parts, alternating with the wet ingredients in two parts. Beat until just combined, then scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl once more, then beat on low for an additional 30 seconds. Take 1/2 cup of the @blueberries{2.5%cups} and crush them with your hands so they are juicy; add to the batter and increase the mixer speed to high for 5 to 10 seconds to encourage the berries to release their juices even more. Immediately reduce the mixer to low and add the rest of the berries, mixing until incorporated evenly throughout the batter, another 30 seconds.

Cover the bowl with #plastic wrap{} and let the batter rest at room temperature for ~{1%hour}.

While the batter is resting, position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 400°F using the convection setting (if possible). Prepare two muffin tins by spraying the inside and border of every other cavity in the muffin tin generously with cooking spray.

Use a 1 tablespoon or 3 tablespoon cookie dough scoop to fill each sprayed cavity with 6 tablespoons of the batter. The first muffin tin will have six cavities filled, whereas the second muffin will have three cavities filled. For the second muffin tin, you'll need to pour water into every other cavity to mimic the placement of the batter in the first muffin tin. Sprinkle the top of each cavity, aiming for the batter and avoiding the pan, with 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar each.

Bake each muffin tin for 18 to ~{22%minutes}, or until the muffins are domed and golden brown around the edges. A skewer inserted into the center of a muffin should come out with a few crumbs attached. Cool the muffins in their muffin tin on a wire rack for ~{15%minutes}, then use an #offset spatula{} to run underneath the edges of the blueberry muffin tops to prevent them from sticking in the pan. Be careful to just run the offset spatula under the edges—you don't want to accidentally cut into the muffin bottom and decapitate the muffin from its top!

After unsticking the muffin tops, keep cooling the muffins in the tins completely to room temperature. DO NOT TRY AND TURN THE MUFFINS OUT WHILE THEY ARE STILL WARM. Because these muffins are so top-heavy, you’ll run the risk of accidentally pulling the tops and bottoms apart if the cake is still warm! Wait until they are cooled completely before turning them out of the pan. Run the offset spatula underneath each muffin top once more and gently tilt the muffin upwards to turn it out of the pan. The muffins are best on the day that they’re made, but can be individually wrapped in plastic and stored at room temperature for up to 2 days.
