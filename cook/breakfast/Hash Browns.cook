Peel 5 to 6 medium sized @potatoes{6%medium} and 1 big @onion{1%large}. Grate them using a #grater{} and place into the #strainer{}. Season with @salt{} and @pepper{}, add @olive oil{} and @cayenne{1%tsp} pepper. Then, squeeze all the liquid out. The more liquid you remove, the crispier your hash browns will be.

Take a nice #large pan{}. Get it nice and hot. Add a glug of olive oil. Place your potato into the pan and pat it down. Make it nice and compact. Next, add flecks of @unsalted butter{70%g}.

Turn over your hash browns by taking a #large plate{}, placing it on top if the pan and flipping over. Then, slide it back into the pan.
