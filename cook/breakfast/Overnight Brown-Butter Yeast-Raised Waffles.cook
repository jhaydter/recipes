Melt @butter{6%Tbsp} in a #3 quart stainless steel saucier or saucepan{}, stirring and scraping with a #heat-resistant spatula{} as it bubbles, and cook until golden brown. Remove from heat and immediately stir in @granulated sugar{4%tsp}, @salt{1%tsp}, and @cold milk{10%oz}, followed by @egg{1%large}. Sift in @all-purpose flour{7.5%oz} and stir until smooth. Add @instant yeast{1.25%tsp} and @baking soda{1/4%tsp} last, stirring to combine. Cover and refrigerate overnight, between 12 and ~{18%hours}. The batter should be gooey and spongy at this point.

Set #waffle iron{} to medium and preheat until the indicator is ready; if using cast iron, brush lightly with safflower, vegetable, or canola oil. For an 8-inch square machine, scrape in half of the batter per batch. For a 7 inch Belgian machine, scrape in about one-third. Close lid and griddle until golden brown but still steaming, 5 to ~{7%minutes} depending on the depth and heat of your machine. (Cooked waffles can be held on a rack in a 200°F (90°C) oven while remaining batches are cooked.) Serve immediately with maple syrup, lemon chantilly, and/or strawberries.
